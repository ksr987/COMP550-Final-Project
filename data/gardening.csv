I am going to be building some raised garden beds here this month for the upcoming spring. I've read of all sorts of plans and ideas online and have come up with the following, and would really love your advice!

I am going to build 3 beds using cedar lumber. The beds will measure 8' x 3', and the lumber is 1""x6"". The wood is a bit on the thin side so I will use some 2x2 posts at each corner, and in the middle (at 4') to help support the bed.

Also, at 6"", the soil will most likely be 4-5"" deep. I plan on tilling up the ground soil as well to give the plants more space to grow into, rather than covering the bottom and stifling root growth.

Do you think this is a sound plan? Working with what I got. I appreciate the help! 

PS: Also wanted to ask about rows! Is it better to make my rows long wise (maybe 2 rows 8' long, spaced 1' apart) or would it be better to go width wise (something like 5 rows, each 3' long, spaced 1-2' apart)?",9,/r/gardening/comments/fx8xg6/can_i_get_some_advice_on_my_raised_garden_bed/

I, a person who has only ever had house plants, realize that am in way over my head with this task. 

I've tried reading up on how to care for these plants and how to nurse them back to health, but I'm not even sure what all these plants are, and whether they are supposed to be there. The landlord knows about there being roses, the previous tenant knew about roses and tulips.

There may also be another person who feels responsible for this garden, as someone keeps spraying the leaves in the morning, so they end up burning in the midday sun. I haven't caught that person yet, but my boyfriend reported seeing this happen. I assume this person is trying to get rid of the pests but his efforts do not seem to do anything.

Any help Identifying the plants and pests in these [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/W14OD8Z) would be greatly appreciated. As well as advice on fighting the infestation, plants to remove, plants to add, how much water to use, how often to add fertilizer, and general applicable gardening tips or things to read up on.

What happened was the previous owner made a rock bed and put a thick plastic liner. The tree eventually got choked out or maybe some bad fungal growth was introduced.

The landlord mentioned that there'd been a problem of pigeons trying to roost on the windowsill outside the main bedroom, but I thought if I fill up the space with window boxes there wouldn't be a problem.

I got to work making the most of my window space, and planted every windowsill up with strawberry plants and herbs, and sowed seeds for flowers and veg. Everything has been fine until yesterday when I discovered two pigeons trampling my chard seedlings outside the bedroom window! I shooed them away and hoped it was just a one-off, but this morning I was woken up by two pigeons, again making themselves very comfortable in my window box, on top of some very battered looking baby chard.

To avoid this, i tried to make beds (with cardboard, choped grass, compost (as veggies/fruits peels), hay with chicken manure and horse manure (already composted)) and mulch in hope the terrain can get better conditions to plant or even plant in the bed.

Is this a good idea? What else can i do to make the soil more adaptable to farming?",9,/r/gardening/comments/g2fyez/tips_to_have_a_good_soil_mix_or_make_soil_softer/

I've got an assortment of vegetables growing indoors inside trays with the intent to move them outdoors when it's a little warmer.  I'm keeping the garden soil/peat moss mixture moist and using growing lights for about 12 hours a day.  Many seeds have sprouted quickly but I'm not sure about my next steps.

My biggest question is did I plant too many seeds in each tray pod, and if so, will they starve themselves?  Should I transplant some sprouting seeds into additional trays?  

When do I need to add fertilizer? I've got slow release 14-14-14 vegetable fertilizer on order but it'll be about a week before it arrives. I have lawn fertilizer, slow release 6-4-0 and 17-0-11. Should I use any of these and when?

g3sqdy,gardening,Topping off raised beds and a few more questions.,"Hello from zone 9b!

I have a few raised beds at home (not the school beds I'm always asking about heh) that are kind of low on soil.  They are brick and attached to the back of the house.  The house was built in the 50s but we don't know when the beds were added or if they are original.  They are about 13'x4'x2' and face west. I recently discovered that they were built on top of the concrete patio soil.  Some of the things planted there clearly did not do so well. When we moved in there were two small trees (or a tall bush?) that recently died one after the other. When pulled their roots were all coiled up, maybe not enough space/depth? The other had a thriving grape vine that sadly died when the house was tented prior to us moving in.  It also had an orange tree that somehow survived.

When my MIL visited a year back she planted a lavender and a sage in one and 2 years ago I had started a new grape vine in the other planter with the orange tree.  Both are very low in soil.  I should have noticed before but it wasn't until I got volunteered to tend to the school garden that I started learning about gardening.  The bed with the lavender needs about 3 inches of soil while the one with the grape needs probably about 6 inches.

I know tomatoes will just grow new roots but what about the sage, lavender, grape vine and orange tree?  What's the right way to top these off?  I'd like to plant something with some height to it (around 4 feet max) on the bed with the lavender for privacy since a couple of our neighbors added second floors that stare right into our living room.  At this time a hardy hibiscus hybrid is a favorite but any suggestions are more than welcome.

I bought my first house in October so this is the first spring I've been here. It's been fun because there are some old gardening beds here and plants are popping up and I have no idea what any of them are and I'm excited to see them bloom!

I live in Zone 5. I definitely got a little ahead of myself and started ordering plants in early April. The websites said they would ship according to zone, so I figured it would be fine. Well, my 5 hydrangea plants were delivered a few days later, and while I kept them on my kitchen counter for 10 days, they were really in the way and I decided to just plant them. (Does this make me a bad plant mom?)

It's finally starting to warm up a bit, so I was hoping they would be okay! I got 5 Limelight hydrangeas. I planted them on 4/18 and the first few days they were okay. But yesterday basically all but 1 were super wilty. I've been watering them every day. They get a few hours of morning sun and a few hours of later afternoon sun. I'm pretty sure I planted them correctly and I put mulch down too (but not touching the woody stem part).

Is it just too cold for them? Transplant shock? Not enough water? I really deeply watered them yesterday and it looks like a lot of rain in the next weeks forecast. If it is too cold, will they come back to life once they warm up or will I have to buy new plants? Any tips or advice would be awesome!

I just closed on a house with an AMAZING garden. The previous owners did great things with it. It has a built in sprinkler system but I know it will use a lot of water. 

I‚Äôm considering installing some rain barrels to try to capture water to use in the garden. The area of the roof which goes into the gutters is almost 1000 sq. ft. so that will harvest a lot of water, even when it rains just a little bit. 

For reference I‚Äôm in central TX. So I know that water shortages are a thing, and when it does rain it rains a LOT. So, what does that mean? A small system will get overwhelmed. And such a system is only really useful if I can use the water at times when it doesn‚Äôt rain. So I‚Äôd like to build as large of a system as I can which is economical (ie. Not totally insane). My city also has a rebate of $0.50/gal for installing a rainwater collection system so a larger system could have a better rebate and not be as expensive. 

I have a spot about 40‚Äù x 50‚Äù on the side of my house which is a great spot for a rain collection system. But I feel like 55 gallon barrels are actually a bit small. If i have one large tank rather than two small ones, I can have something like a 300 or 400 gallon system.

But... is there a way to do that economically? Where do you get large barrels? The 55 gallon ones are pretty standard and things bigger than that seem hard to get and/or much much more expensive.",9,/r/gardening/comments/g7k5gy/where_to_get_large_rain_barrels/

g8g7xh,gardening,Seedlings damping off - Critique my seed starting process!,"&amp;#x200B;

[Cardoon damping off](https://imgur.com/a/A9q61Ra)

This is going to be a detailed post as I want to explain each step I'm taking in the process of starting seeds.

Here are my steps - is there something here that's contributing to dampening off? Maybe the step of transplanting the young seedlings out of their starting tray?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Start seedlings in a burpee 6x6 (1"" cells) seed starting tray, with heat mat (80 deg F), dome, and espoma organic seed starter mix. Everything's been sterilized with Hydrogen peroxide. From this tray I started Cardoon, Habanero, and Melon - I grouped these together as they all like warm condition. Heater in room to keep temp around 80 (room holds heat nicely, not too bad energy wise)
2. **Seeds successfully germinate, sprouting out of soil and looking strong.** I've read that seedling should be taken off heat / out of the dome upon sprouting, but since my seeds are germinating at drastically different times, I don't have the luxury of taking the whole tray off of heat, so I'm transplanting young seedling out of the tray once the ""fake"" leaves unfurl, leaving the ungerminated seedlings undisturbed
3. Transplant young seedlings once sprouted (before true leaves) - *Is this the issue - should I be leaving them in the dome longer?* At this point, I'll either spoon out the whole plug, or section out a smaller section if there are other seedlings in the cell. This will be transplanted to a 3"" peat pot, with a warmed/wet mixture of 50/50 seed starting mix/potting soil. and put 5"" below a T5 grow light
4. This is the point at which I'm noticing that about 30% of seedlings seem to quickly decline and show signs of damping off the same day.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts? Can I provide any more information?

* am I transplanting seedlings from the starting tray too early (keep on heat/dome until true leaves), or too late (transplant as soon as it sprouts out of the ground)?
* Is the actual act of transplanting the young seedlings shocking them to death, or stunting growth enough to allow damping off to set in?",9,/r/gardening/comments/g8g7xh/seedlings_damping_off_critique_my_seed_starting/

We have been taking car of my grandparents and father's grave site for many years. About 5 years ago their part of the cemetery got overtaken by a really nasty weed - field bindweed (according to an app I downloaded).  So far, we have been planting annuals. I've been reading about field bindweed and the only way to get rid of it is either with some heavy chemicals or by constantly pulling them out, which is not possible for us as we live about 2 hours away.

Last year I tried using fabric and it was an improvement, but the weeds still managed to get through the openings where the flowers (annuals) were planted. Hope I'm making sense :)

This year we are thinking about planting couple of bushes. There is no shade and, obviously, it's not possible to constantly water the plant.

What are our options? The cemetery is close to NYC.

I would really appreciate your advice as this battle has been going on for years...

g9q488,gardening,Mulch bed intimidation - need some advice,"Hi! My husband and I are quite intimidated by the large mulch beds on our property. We are first-time homeowners and just moved in to our house in the winter. 

When spring-like weather started this month the mulch beds had a massive amount of weeds and grass come up. The mulch is very shallow, in fact, you can see bald spots (dirt) in some areas. We‚Äôve tried pulling the weeds, as well as treating them with a weed killer, but a lot of them are growing through the fabric under the mulch, and so when you pull them, you‚Äôre pulling up on the fabric. When we use weed killer, it doesn‚Äôt get through the fabric to penetrate roots. 

The fabric under the mulch is also in piles and needs to either be laid back down nicely, or removed altogether. 

I think the weeds are because the mulch isn‚Äôt deep enough. But the mulch beds are raised up over the border of the beds (if that makes sense?). It‚Äôs like a mound of mulch with a border around it? So I‚Äôm thinking we need to:

1. Remove all mulch
2. Throw away the fabric under the mulch
3. Treat dirt for weeds
4. Dig out the dirt so the dirt level is 2-4 inches below the border of the mulch beds

g9sbbi,gardening,What should I try planting this summer? Quebec.,"Hello!

Every year I plant the same thing; cucumbers and tomatoes that yield a ton of fruit, then some random thing that usually dies and yields nothing (last year it was strawberries)

I planted some lettuce once and it yielded OK but got eaten by something.

This year, I'm expanding my garden considerably (like x4) and it was already a nice little space.

  
I'd like to try growing new things this year but I'm pretty intimidated by failure. What are some hardy, easy crops like cucumbers and tomatoes that I can experiment with this year? I pretty much like all vegetables.",9,/r/gardening/comments/g9sbbi/what_should_i_try_planting_this_summer_quebec/

fsoyck,gardening,Trying to Find The Name of a Flower From My Childhood,"Hi there\~ I've been searching everywhere and I *cannot* find what the flower (at least, I think it was a flower) that grew in my childhood backyard is. What I remember about it is as follows:

It was only a few inches tall, with a green stalk (no leaves, that I recall) and half of the flower's height was tiny, round purple (like, a rich indigo color) bulb/pod things, all the way around and up to the very top, where they progressively got smaller. The reason I'm not 100% it's a flower is because I never actually saw these things ever ""bloom."" They were ALWAYS just tiny, round pods. I saw them in the middle of our unshaded yard, but also I found plenty of them in a shaded/semi-shaded wooded area, in case you need to know the sunlight requirements. They were wild and grew on their own... I think only in spring or summer? They didn't grow in bushes or anything, they grew individually, but were usually in small groups near each other. As for if you need to know the region, I lived in the middle of Virginia, USA. 

Sorry for rambling, but I haven't seen or heard of these flowers (?) in years and I'm dying to know what the hell they actually are. Thank you so much!",8,/r/gardening/comments/fsoyck/trying_to_find_the_name_of_a_flower_from_my/

How hard is it to grow herbs? Specifically cilantro, rosemary, sage, thyme, and basil? Will they probably die on my first try? What do I need to be precise about? What time of year do you start? Is now okay? What light do they need/what side of my house do I plant them on? Is it better to start from baby plants or from seeds?

And here‚Äôs the biggest question: does the cost of starting and maintaining a garden add up to much? I picture myself saving a lot, but I could be underestimating gardening. Would I save money?

The ones from last year were brown with short spiky things sticking out, and they seemed to be coming somewhat under control.

But boy howdy - this one was in a tree growing near the shop, and I recently found similar in a pine tree off the entry avenue. Are we being invaded by aliens?

This year Id like to go a bit bigger. I have some wodden pallets that Im building into raised beds. There will be at least 1 bed 3ft x 10ft but possibly 2 of that size. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main question is... what do I plant? I know thats a loaded question but hear me out. Ive got a list of veggies that my family will most likely eat so obviously I'd start there. Peppers, Potatoes, Beans, Sweet Corn, Kale, Sweet Potatoes (likely only for thanksgiving), Tomatoes, Cucumbers and Strawberries.

&amp;#x200B;

Of these plants, what combination would be the best use of my space? Im keeping in mind that taller stuff should be on the North side, like corn cucumbers and beans. I also assume I wont have room for all this - and somethings will be planted at different times than others.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?

2. If I prune regularly, could I keep the size to 2-3m tall? I don't want giant monsters that block all our sunlight!

I'm open to trying to espalier but I'm a fairly green gardener. I considered pots but I hear trees just grow better in the ground, and fruit better that way too.

My partner just wants to put all the fruit trees in the backyard but I'd love a little orchard at the front :) Any ideas appreciated, thanks!",8,/r/gardening/comments/g06tx0/fruit_trees_in_front_yard/

I immediately transplanted it into a cube pot that's 15"" or so all across and used this potting mix (https://www.seasoil.com/container-complete-sea-soil.html). It has a pH of 5.5. It's only been a few days but the leaves have grown bigger and it's putting out new leaves and overall looks greener! Very excited.

But what should I do now from here? I wanted to buy a soil pH meter but google tells me that these are often not accurate. I'm not sure if the potting mix I am using now will continue to be acidic enough for my blueberry bush to thrive. Should I get some acidic fertilizer like ammonium sulfate? Or just dump some coffee grounds on top of the potting mix?

I'm not sure how old this bush is, but it's about 26 inches tall. Should I start pruning now? Not clear from the pic but there's a cane (?) that's growing really sideways. Should I just leave it?

I have come to you for advice on what flowers to plant in my front garden. I am not very good at gardening and don't even know where to start looking. 

I am looking for some hardy plants that will like a lot of sun and can stand the heat. I live in Northern Australia so it gets hot during the summer.

I would like the plant to flower most of the year if possible and not grow higher than about 40cm as they will fill the gaps around some low hedges that currently live there.

g4jnrz,gardening,First time gardeners - what size tomato cage do we need for indeterminate tomatoes?,"During this pandemic my wife and I have decided to give gardening a try. It‚Äôs the first time for both of us and we‚Äôre very excited. We‚Äôre starting pretty simple with 4 tomato plants and 3 peppers plants. We may get more after we get these worked. We‚Äôre going to grow everything in containers. We‚Äôre going to put the tomatoes in a 22.5 whiskey barrel and the peppers in 5 gal buckets (I‚Äôve had no luck finding nursery pots). We‚Äôre ordering everything online because we want to avoid going to the stores. This has made it much more difficult to gather all the supplies. After ordering potting mix, fertilizers, gardening lime, bamboo stakes, twine and a bunch of other things I realized I forgot tomato cages and mulch so I will be placing a second order for those. 

Here‚Äôs the plants we have:

\- 2 better boy tomato plants (indeterminate)

\- 1 super sweet 100 tomato plant (indeterminate)

\- 1 roma tomato plant (determinate)

\- 1 each of banana pepper, hot cayenne pepper and jalapeno pepper 

I‚Äôve read enough to gather that the indeterminate tomatoes may grow significantly humongous. 

Here‚Äôs my question. What size tomato cage do I need for the tomatoes (especially the indeterminate)? The tallest cage I found at Home Depot is 54 inches. With the cage in the soil that is only going to be about 4 foot tall. Is that tall enough? Couldn‚Äôt the tomatoes get up to 6 ft tall assuming we don‚Äôt screw this up and they thrive? I‚Äôm not sure how to properly support these tomatoes. 

I think a 42 inch cage for the peppers will be OK. Staking them up may be good enough and not even need a cage. 

Any tips welcome and thank you in advance!",8,/r/gardening/comments/g4jnrz/first_time_gardeners_what_size_tomato_cage_do_we/

I am pretty sure that the purple and magenta ones are a type of Sugar Snap Pea and the white and light pink ones are Snow Peas.

I bought them unmarked as sprouts and planted them, but they were sold for human consumption, and therefore edible (I hope).

The seed pods are not hairy like I have seen with *Lathyrus odoratus*.

The purple and pink flowers grew fatter, smaller seed pods that are about two inches long with a relatively straight edge.

I'd consider myself a pretty experienced gardener, but I've always been lucky enough to live in a place that already had beds established, just in need of revamping. Until now. I live in the country, and we have a small building that houses the well. It sits in a grassy circle, about 1400 sq feet, and the driveway loops around this area. The grassy area is ugly and annoying to mow, so I decided I wanted to pull up the sod and put in a pollinator garden. I worked with my local Soil &amp; Water department to get a pollinator/native plant mix this winter and am exited to get it in the ground. However, looking at the area, the idea of tearing up the sod is pretty intimidating. I've never had an area this large that I needed to tear up before and I'm not sure what the best way would be.

g7cbwb,gardening,Trying to Understand Self-Incompatibility (Specifically in Plants),"I have a couple Solanum Peruvianum (Peruvian Tomato) plants going and was reading that they are self incompatible. I think I understand the basics, in that the sexual parts of the plant are able to stop pollen from entering and producing fruit in the plant. 

It says to plant multiple of the same plants together to increase likelihood of pollination so I assume it‚Äôs not impossible for self incompatible plants to be compatible (which I guess stands to reason) but my question is, if I have other tomato plants, or nightshade plants(?) nearby, how does that affect the the genetics of the plant. 

For instance, if it gets cross pollinated with a nearby tomato plant, does that make the seeds that I would save from the self incompatible fruit a hybrid species? I assume a self incompatible species does it to prevent ‚Äúinbreeding‚Äù and therefore the plant should benefit from cross pollination of species (in theory). Is this true?

g7mvbf,gardening,"[HELP] attractive, cheap, DIY garden fence ideas? love the look of cable wire: is it feasible? or alternative w/ same minimalist look? Just need to keep my pup out of my flowerbeds...","I rent, and am on a budget. I splurged on perennials this year and planted a big bed around the circumference of my backyard. I'm thrilled with it, but need something attractive to keep my dog out (small, corgi/pom)--technically, it needn't be much taller than 16"" above ground, but when the dogs in the yard to the back are out--well, it might be safer to size it up to about 24"" if possible. 

I was stunned at the prices of the prefab crap available on Amazon and the like. I need about 40' of fencing, and attractive options (i.e., not your green PVC covered hoop stuff) would begin around $200 minimum, if I was lucky to find items on sale. 

So started to think of a DIY solution. The main thing is it needs to be relatively tall, but not obfuscate the view of the flowers. Was looking at [cable rail](https://www.coastal-cable.com/cable-basics/) like that on decks, and it'd be perfect, aesthetically speaking, and I *think* I've found some very cost-effective ways to put it together (see the [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUf62zLEFCr3pyIcVN0BNLED8hrOz9Fn) videos I've collected to-date on this topic). 

However, modifying this to get the look of cable wire, suitable just to keep a dog out of the flower bed, with the constraints of renting (not being able to set fenceposts in cement, just bracing w/ gravel/burying deeply etc.), and above all, on a budget, has been a real challenge. I thought that, ideally, I could do 2x2s instead of 4x4s, buried 1/3 w/ gravel and in heavy clay, possibly pegged w/ a 2x6 against the direction of tension, spaced about 4' apart (about 36"" ea, 12"" in ground). But the cable wire system requires on *tension* for support, and my problem, apparently is that it is just ""more"" fence than I really need, and because of that, I'm not sure that it's feasible if based on tensioning. 

To do this on the cheap, I need to minimize the use of the hardware like turnbuckles ([here's](https://imgur.com/sgx4gom) a screenshot from one of the DIY videos w/ suggested HW laid out). But I have no idea where to find information on the requirements for the posts, *if* not cemented in the ground/made of 4x4s--cable rail construction is all governed by building guidelines for decks (not to mention mandating a taller and stronger fence than I need). If I remember right, the load-bearing posts have to be able to sustain 500 lbs of force (not sure what direction or any specifics, but you get the point--I don't need something this strong). Plus there are four 45 deg + turns, which means more and different kind of tension on the fenceposts. I don't think that having turnbuckles at the endposts only, as in the designs I've seen, would work for me here with 1) thinner posts 2) not set in concrete and 3) , but is there any civil engineering calculator or the like one knows of to figure this out?

Alternatively, does anyone have any suggestions on how to fake the cable wire look without turnbuckles--is there other, cheaper hardware to tighten cable or wire and make it look ""neat""? I don't mind tuning it up once a year, and it doesn't have to be strong enough to meet code--just look attractive, stay up, and keep the dog out. Maybe using 8 gauge wire, more eyebolts, and no turnbuckles? Is there something else that will keep wire or wire rope taught? 

I did find [this](http://www.grandmashousediy.com/conduit-deck-rails/) other idea that is somewhat similar and actually pretty cheap (except that I'd need to get the supplies delivered from Home Depot, which tacks on $79+): using 1/2"" conduit, strapped to the posts. Since it's rigid, it doesn't require any sort of tension. However, not as sure about how the metal, even if galvanized, would hold up in rainy Portland, Oregon winters. Any idea on how this does outdoors over the years, in a rainy environment?

Or otherwise, any other great, attractive DIY garden fence ideas? As minimalistic as possible, as cheap as possible, but avoiding the chickenwire-stapled-on-garden-stakes look?

g9s2dz,gardening,"Question/Opinion on timing of planting starts, particularly tomatoes","Hi!! I have been gardening for a few seasons now. This is my second year growing tomatoes from seed  and I have planted basically according to schedule noted on the back of the seed packets for my zone 8b which mostly recommend planting indoors 6-8 weeks before planting outside. I target an outdoor planting date of 5/15 per my local nursery (and my late grandma &lt;3) and I started my seeds mid March so I am right on schedule according to the packets. My starts are about 4"" tall and doing fine however I know lots of people plant **WAY** before this, even as early as January. Is the benefit to just plant a bigger tomato plant and get a head start? There are some local people who are selling tomato plants now that are very well established and 6x the size of mine. I guess I just wanted to know if there is any reasoning aside from just bigger is better and am confused on why the packet instructions seem to contradict this. Should I start as early as possible? Do bigger plants at planting give a better yeild?

Also for other veggies, do you just plant as soon as possible? Ie: I already planted pole beans in the ground and they are about 6"" now, but I see that the recommended date from my local nursery for those is 6/1... will mine not produce as well since I planted 2 months early?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've planted 3 yellow-red coreopsis and 2 golden coreopsis variants on Saturday. I dug deep, used garden soil to fill in around the root-ball. I'm in Texas, and it's been averaging a bout 75-80F last couple of days during the day time. These flowers are getting \~8 hours of sun, as they are under a tall tree without many leaves on the side these flowers sit.

I've watered them deeply on Saturday, right after planting from the pots.

On Monday, there was a rain of about \~0.3 inches of accumulated precipitation over \~4 hours.

Things were still looking good on Tuesday Morning. Then comes Tuesday afternoon, the foliage started to droop without anything done to them. Flowers still seemed to be OK except one or two.

Today (Wedsnesday), things are becoming worse, the foliage is drooping even more, and flowers are dying as well.

Interestingly, only the yellow-red variant is doing this (all 3 of them), and golden coreopsis seems to be holding up OK so far (all 2 of them), although it may be just a matter of time. I've looked at the moisture level using a moisture meter, down at the root level, they are still moist, but top surface is dry.

There is rain forecast for tomorrow, and the next few days. (3 inches over the next week). What should I do? is it pest? fungus? could they make this drastic change in a day? Will these flowers recover?",7,/r/gardening/comments/ftei3u/dying_coreopsis_4_days_after_planting_what_could/

fv2t3u,gardening,How much fruit &amp; veg to grow to become self-sufficient?,"Hey everyone,

Not sure if this is the place to post, but wonder if someone can help with the following question?

Is there a website or calculation I can do to figure out how much fruit and veg someone would need to plant in order to be self-sustainable or as near to self-sustainable etc? Is there a rough guide anywhere?

Example: A family of 2 plant-based eaters living on x amount of land and then if you wanted to provide for 4, 6, 8, 10+ people would you just need to double, triple your plantings etc?

While I‚Äôm just a first time gardener (first time renting a house) experimenting with 7 garden boxes and 5 straw bales in our regular sized garden in the burbs (USDA Zone 9A), I always dream of owning some land and growing most of our food so I‚Äôm trying to research how feasible and viable it would be to achieve self-sustainability. 

Things like rice, flour and various other grains seem like that would require a lot of space and be a bit tricky hence why it would be great to be as near to self-sustainable as possible and not necessarily 100% self-sustainable.

Anyway, thanks for reading and I appreciate any feedback!",7,/r/gardening/comments/fv2t3u/how_much_fruit_veg_to_grow_to_become/

I came home last autumn with a bag full, which my husband promptly 'put away' under the stairs.

Some of the bulbs are sprouting little white tails, so I don't think they are dormant. [Photo for reference](http://imgur.com/a/u2qiq1W).

Can I pop them into pots and let them play out, then plant in autum? Could I add them to my beds like originally planned now? If some are dormant, what do I do to keep them for the right planting time?

These are 4‚Äôx 4‚Äô squares surrounded within a paver patio in the back yard and I‚Äôd like to try square foot gardening there. Before even starting, I have noticed an abundance of squirrels and rabbits in the neighborhood that I know are going to cause me issues down the road. Since I‚Äôm already working with a limited space, I don‚Äôt want to take up room with sacrificial plants for the animals (and I‚Äôve heard that it just encourages more until they overrun the whole thing). 

Growing up we had outdoor dogs and they pretty well kept everything run off of the yard but I don‚Äôt have any yet. I‚Äôve looked a bit at wire fencing, but I‚Äôd like something a bit more aesthetic since my garden is going to be part of my landscaping. I also think that the fencing would make working in the garden difficult and anything low enough to not be in the way probably won‚Äôt do anything to keep squirrels out. 

I‚Äôve heard of using both plastic owls and rubber snakes to scare them off, but does that do any good for the long term or do they wise up pretty fast? 

Any other advice for things that I should do? I‚Äôll probably plant next weekend so I‚Äôve got a bit of time to order materials before sprouting if needed

Lots of gardening this time of year eh?

I have a ton of seeds and will hopefully be saving my own in the upcoming years! (A bit complicated and conflicting info but I‚Äôm getting the hang of it)

I want to build a seed chest!!!! (I do a lot of woodwork)

I‚Äôm trying to plan it out. 

I‚Äôd like ATLEAST 6 catagories 

(Direct sew winter cold frame ) Top level: sew every 3weeks - more spring winter stuff (lettuce, spinach, mustard, cabbage, kale)
(I know you don‚Äôt start kale every 3 weeks but I can‚Äôt make it too complicated) 

Mid level
Start indoors: tomato, pepper, eggplant, squash, herbs, 

Bottom level
(Direct sew spring) Start outdoors after last frost: cucumber, peas, flowers, trees(?),

And then have them further organized into cubbies for type of veg. 


Is there anything I should keep in mind for dimensions? Does anyone have any organizational advice? I have to keep all seeds in little envelopes, probably make it standard seed package size.

Of course, every morning when I open it, I notice it got humid AF. It's way too cold at night to keep it open and it will soon get too cold to open in the day too, having max 5C

Most of my pots have tiny fungi growing on the soil. Some super small orange flat one, one that looks hairy like tiny mushrooms on dead leaves, and grey mold over decent portions of soil. I have kept watering minimal but as the plants are still sprouts, I want to ensure the soil is moist for them.

What can I do? Do I need to do anything? Is fungi okay?",7,/r/gardening/comments/fxjj00/help_cant_stop_fungi_growing_in_my_greenhouse/

Recently though, I've become enamored with the idea of planting native perennials for pollinators, but I'm conflicted. For almost all of them, I've read that seed planting should happen mid/end of March, but it's already well into April. I'm not sure if I should be purchasing seeds and going through the normal steps (cold stratification), buy plugs, or go with other plants instead. There's a local nursery selling seeds, and several doing plant delivery at a high shipping cost. Currently, I have these plants on my list, for reference:

* Monarda fistulosa
* Monarda didyma
* Lobelia siphilitica
* Rudbeckia hirta
* Liatris spicata

I have never planted a tree before, so I want to make sure I'm doing it right. From what I've read online, the need for soil amenities is dependant on how well the soil drains. So I tested it out by filling the hole where I'm planting with water, as well as in a container filled with the same soil. It took approximately 5 hours to drain the water and one hour to drain in the container. I assume this means the drainage is moderate? With that said, is there a need to amend the soil? If so, with what (brand names would be helpful so I know what to pick up). Or will it be okay if I just plant it straight in the ground? Also, should I use mulch around the tree?

I am lucky that I have a good amount of property and can dedicate about .5 acres to this.

Have a number of plants coming and will be doing at least 1 row of a VSP and 1 row of TWC... (the first 3 rows will be 100 feet long)

Rows are North to South running with a good amount of sun with clear land around, just two dwarf peach trees off of one side, about 10 feet away.

I am also likely to do 1 row of Modified Munson Trellis for Somerset Seedless.

Rows are planned 7 feet apart.   There will be a garden fence about 5 feet tall that is 1x2 welded wire... so not blocking much if any sun.

For the rows, which should be where?  East to west... VSP, Munson or TWC?

I have dogs and so im scared they‚Äôll find ways to find the scraps. If its in the ground they‚Äôll dig it up. If its in a pile theyll break their way in.,7,/r/gardening/comments/g3mty8/compost_piles_vs_burying_food_scraps/

g3ykqi,gardening,Complete newbie - looking for advice or resources to determine what to plant and how to be successful,"Hello! I'm in zone 8b (with the caveat that I get heat similar to zone 9 and have been advised from a master
gardne led course that anything planned in this area should be good for zone 9 if it's to survive the Summer).

I have 3 raised garden beds that are currently in full sun. I want to grow vegetables. Two of the beds aren't filled, so I can fill them with whatever would be best. I can't start seeds inside.

Any advice or resources aimed at a complete newbie would be great. My short term goal is (1) determine what to fill the beds with, (2) determine what to plant and when to plant it (for now through 3 months from now), and (3) create a maintenance plan for every plant so that I know when and how much to water, when and how to fertilize, when and how to prune/dead head/etc., common diseases and how to treat them, common pests and how to handle them, and when to harvest.

I think I want to do square foot gardening.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first year I am trying to do some gardening and grow my vegetables. I do have a couple of questions and I thought I will ask the wonderful Reddit community for help.

I bought the below from Lowes and the instructions ask to use a potting mix.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, I got a raised bed mix. I would like to know if i can use the raised bed mix instead of the suggested porting mix.

We have a large pine tree in our front yard, right outside our windows. I love it because I can hear all of the birds singing each morning. I started to notice cocoons that looked like they were made of pine needles, and we sent a photo to a family friend who specializes in tree care. He said that they‚Äôre bag works and will be very dangerous to our pine tree if we let it go for too long. He has offered to come out and spray the tree to get rid of them, saying that it‚Äôs the only way to really kill them all and prevent it from getting worse. 

My question is, will this spray hurt the birds that live in the tree? I‚Äôm sure some are building nests or may already have eggs.. will the spray hurt the babies or cause the parents not to come back? If so, is it best to wait until winter to spray so that way the birds aren‚Äôt there, or is he right that it needs to be done as soon as possible?

I'm hoping that this is just a normal life process but everyone I have ever known to have hydrangeas has had flowers that last all season.

Right now I am trying to germinate some thyme seeds indoors (recommended for my climate zone this time of year) for culinary purposes.

I have done ""some"" research online for how to germinate indoors for thyme.  

One thing that confuses me is everywhere I have seen, is that they say to keep in a ""warm"" area.

How warm is the ""warm"" they mention?   Room temperature? 80 degrees F?  Warmer?

I have also wondered if sunlight is required this early in the process.   I know the sunlight will add extra warmth to the soil, but is the sunlight necessary if the seedlings, and their leaves, haven't even formed yet?

g9eja6,gardening,Can someone point me at a reference to which plants can be harvested continually vs only once?,"I seem to be able to find this information on each plant specifically, but I'm growing a few dozen different things, and I'm not sure what else I might want to invest the time into. 

I'm looking mostly for plants that can be harvested over and over again, indefinitely. But I also grow some things that can be harvested a few times, like buttercrunch lettuce, which turns bitter about two months after planting.

Is there a reference somewhere that indicates which plants and varieties can be harvested once, a few times, infinite times?

- I'm growing indoors hydroponically, so zone and frost do not apply, and I control the temperature, humidity, airflow, lighting, etc.  But your sidebar asks for general location, so I'm in the wet part of Eastern Texas.
- I've been doing this for about a year. So far, I seem to have wild success with everything except fruit/berries (which never germinate) and microgreens/sprouts (which keep growing mold). So I learn my limitations, and I just don't grow those things anymore. I can't be bothered to manage multiple different nutrient mixtures. But it's really fascinating to see how many wildly-different things seem happy in identical conditions!

This year I want to try my hand at growing some veggies from seed. I really should have started them a week or two ago, so don't want to delay any longer. 

I stupidly realized today that I don't have any seed starting mix, but I've heard it's easy to make your own. However, I've read a bunch of different recipes and am throughly confused.Like everyone else I'm quarantined at home, and don't want to go out for something so superfluous. I also don't want to order from Amazon because of the strikes. 

So two main questions:

1.  Am I supposed to put compost in the seed mix? Some sites say yes, some sites say the mix should totally sterile. (I don't actually have compost so I'm hoping the answer is no!)

2. Can I substitute something for vermiculite? I don't have any vermiculite. Lots of recipes say you should add it, but not all do. 

Here's what I've got on hand:

* coconut coir

* perlite

* turface

* pumice

* orchid bark

* chicken grit (granite gravel)

* sphagnum moss

* Regular houseplant soil

* slow release fertilizer pellets

I was thinking maybe the turface could replace the vermiculite?

I have it growing in a pot that sits on a step that gets a lot of morning sun, but shade in the afternoon/evening from the overhanging roof. I water it every day or every other day. 

There are some wild chickens in my area that my dad feeds, and they've recently discovered my plant pots and now have been running through and digging up my plants, much to my dismay. When I checked yesterday, I found that they had ripped off some of the little leaves and now one of the plants seems to be wilting and limp now. I was so excited at the idea of growing my own chamomile tea, and right now due to the whole COVID situation, I can't go and buy another plant from the garden centre.

[This is how the chamomile looks right now](https://imgur.com/a/0xOyGDQ). 

Also, should I repot it? I had planted it in soil mix, however I have some new potting mix that I bought a few weeks ago. The clerk at the garden centre told me that planting seedlings in potting mix is much better as it has all that they need to grow and then when they're more established, I could then transfer them to soil. I didn't know this before. Should I repot it using potting mix? However if it's weak now I don't want to traumatize and possibly kill it.

Hey all,

I was recently laid off, and just moved into a house in Brooklyn with a yard. Which is great for quarantining. However, it needs some love. 

I picked up a bunch of garden tools, shovel, hoe, etc. 

I was thinking I could tear out all the weeds and till up the soil to try and level it out and then grow some grass. Is that my best play here? If so what kind of grass would you suggest for nyc? If not what, what should I do? 

I was also hoping to grow bushes or vines along the cement wall, and cover the chain link fence with either lattice board or reed coverings. Eventually build a raised garden bed. 

Am I crazy? Is there something else I should do?

Long time lurker first time poster. I grew up in nyc so I‚Äôm an idiot when it comes to gardening other than I know plants need varying degrees of sun and water. I‚Äôve got two young kids and a ton of time on my hands thanks to the quarantine, so I want to start growing veggies to cut down on my grocery bill and hopefully lose some dependency on the grocery store.

I live in new haven CT (zone 6b) and my landlords are a cool young couple who are down with having a small/medium raised bed situation in the backyard. I‚Äôve also got a lot of planting pots of varying sizes that I‚Äôve grown a few tomatoes and peppers and basil in. Between the raised bed, the 6 large pots, and the 6 or 7 small/medium sized pots, I think I could get a decent crop growing. I like the idea of growing hearty, fool proof early spring stuff like beets, carrots, spinach, etc. I‚Äôd also like to grow some herbs like basil, thyme, etc. The thing that overwhelms and intimidates me is planning out garden plots, cross pollination, seeding, and basically anything that goes beyond beginner gardening. I‚Äôd also like to include the kids in it too so my question is, what veggies can I grow that‚Äôs somewhat fool proof, yields a pretty abundant crop, and doesn‚Äôt take much maintenance aside from watering, weeding, and other routine care?

Since one of the issues is root intrusion towards my house I can‚Äôt replace them anything nearly as large. 

Here‚Äôs my site specs/desires to help crowd source some ideas of what to replace them with. 

Zone 8b. PMW Heavy clay soil. Minimum 6hrs of sun in the summer. Rhododendron friendly area. On north side of house, next to black asphalt. Area has drip about6‚Äô away, I could easily snake a line over there. 

I need an evergreen. I prioritize Oregon and Northern California Natives and edibles. 10 is ideal, up to 15‚Äô is fine. The bottom 4‚Äô can thin out over time but everything higher would be best very dense. 

It/they will probably need to handle some seasonal standing water. It gets very soggy now for maybe 20 minutes while the mature trees soak up runoff. 

Everyone passes it to get to the house so it would be cool to have something visually interesting, but that‚Äôs just a bonus. It would get close foot traffic so I can have thorns or other unfriendly characteristics.",6,/r/gardening/comments/fv0j68/birch_replacement_ideas_needed/
fv1ijm,gardening,Planted a bunch of different seeds last month; would like to know an estimate for when they should show sprouts,"Hi! I planted a large variety of seeds last month, and would just like to have a general idea for when I should start seeing sprouts. I planted some around the 20th last month, and more at the end of the month.

These are the flower types I planted: Zinnia, Forget-Me-Not, Poppy, Calendula, Aster, Marigold, Daisy, Wildflower assortment, Tulip (these I planted last November), and Roses (from previous years)

So far, apart from the tulips which are growing fine and the roses just being there, I think I only see sprouts from the daisies. I don't know if this is normal, or if it's because of the average 10 degree Celsius climate in Canada (the zone map says I'm in Zone 6), or if I'm watering wrong or something.

I've avoided watering the tulips if the soil isn't super dry. For the other flowers, I've been lightly watering once a day, just enough to soak the top layer of the soil. For reference, I basically sprinkled the seeds around and also some loosened top soil to cover them. (I don't know when to start mixing in Miracle-Gro, so I held off for now.)

Quarantine is a good opportunity to spend time working outside. My neighbor was going to help but now I have to go it alone. She told me ‚Äúmiracle grow gardening soil‚Äù and top soil is what I need? Do I remove dirt? Do I mix it in with what is there? Am I even using the right words? The area I want to plant the hostas is along the fence with sun in the first half of the day.

fvvzaz,gardening,Help with a weed ridden gardening patch,"Hello,

I'm new here and haven't used much reddit but thought this would be the best place to come for some advice on this.

We've rented a house for around 6 years now and had this gardening patch to grow things in installed by the landlord then. He put these big wood things down which I think are railway sleepers? and filled it with what he claimed was very good soil. I noticed that it had a lot of roots in it which I think were from weeds and subsequently had a lot of problems with weeds. For a couple of years I tried growing things in it.

Year 1 - I grew some green beans, carrots I think, some lettuce on the top. I got so overwhelmed with weeding. Every day there was a field of little green shoots popping up, they then grew fast into weeds and it was hard to keep up.

Year 2 - I grew some beans again, and some other things that I think I gave up on because of weeds. I also planted some potatoes that had started growning stalks and we had lots of potatoes for a good few months. The potatoes were the best thing we had out of that patch but eventually I couldn't keep up with the weeding and big weeds grew around the potato plants.

Year 3 - I gave up due to work and just left it. It was a sea of weeds and looked awful. Eventually our landlord came down and put poison down and all the weeds died.

Its been pretty much left since then but weeds grow there again. So I have a few questions if you would be able to help here?

**Because the poison was down a few years ago, would it be safe to grow vegetables again?**

**Is there anything more I can do about the weeds?** Is it due to all the roots? Or the massive field next to our house which is just left abandoned?

**If I can use it again, any suggestions on what I should grow?** Thinking about the time of year and I don't know if you can tell from the photo but there is a darker end that gets less sun. The potatoes grew pretty good there.

I can take more pictures if needed.

Thank you for any advice :)

I've lived on the second floor of an apartment for 2 years. One of my favorite ways to relax on a nice day is to sit on the balcony and read, listen to music, etc. But every spring and summer I've been here, the insects have been bad, particularly wasps and hornets. I suspect the biggest culprit of this is the neighbor below us has several hummingbird feeders which really seem to attract them. It's so bad that I can't enjoy sitting on the balcony for longer than 5 minutes before being swarmed. They also have a constant habit of building nests on parts of my balcony that I have to get rid of. As you can tell it's very annoying so I would like to know if anyone has any tips they've used to deal with similar problems. Most internet searches seem to revolve around gardens, so with me being on a small second story balcony I can't do most of the stuff they suggest.

Looking at the security camera, Location 1 seems to start getting sun at 8am and stops at around 5pm because of the fence and house to the left. Location 2 gets sun from sun-up until sun-down constantly. There is nothing to give location 2 shade. I am not sure how the sun will change as we get more into summer though. The hose connection to the house is right at the bottom of the deck stairs. So, Location 2 is closer to the hose. I am planning on making a drip irrigation system, so closeness to the hose is important. I'm stuck between both locations. I labeled the location of our old garden, that I am tearing down, in the picture as well.

I was planning on making a 2 tiered bed and put the tomatoes on the higher tier so that they can get more soil and help shade if needed.

fydy40,gardening,What's Wrong with my Avocado Plant?,"Hi All Avocado Growers/Gardeners,

Does anyone know what's wrong with our avocado plant?

We call him Igor, grew him from a pip. He's almost 2 years old and was re-potted twice, standard potting sol to gravel 1:1 parts. After the 2nd repot Igor's leaves got brown from the tip inwards and bristly. He's still growing, branches and new leaves but the new leaves are much smaller now.

Additionally some of his leaves now curl up and drop off. I'm holding one into the camera on the pic.

He's in a clay pot, gets watered between 1-2 times a week, shallow watering, and maybe every 2 weeks or so one of those is a bigger watering because he's mopey otherwise. Proper teenager.

&amp;#x200B;

We have no clue what's wrong with him. Looks a bit like salt burn to me, but he's our first proper avocado plant, so lay-man alert.

Igor lives in a sunny spot on the window sill near the radiator. He's got a bit of shade so the evening sun doesn't fry him via a cardboard sun-shade. He's not changed spot at all since he germinated. Same sunny spot + shade.

Any tips welcome.

fyhkk7,gardening,Advice on germination and transplanting,"Hey all! 

First time posting here ! So I got into gardening (and really it‚Äôs more like light farming) when I moved into my current apartment two years ago because it had plots in the backyard that also kinda broke down so I ended up creating plots between them resulting in a fairly large size garden space. I got really into planting and yielding food the last two years and have had really good luck with tomatoes. 

Now this year I decided to start more plants in doors but right now I have two dilemmas. First, I was using a soil I mixed to start seeds but many of them were getting rotten before they sprouted so I ended up buying a seed starting mix that has peet moss and other things in it. I set some seeds up by soaking them and then planting them in this substrate and pacing them in a shallow container with a plastic cover over the top. The lone cucumber sprouted pretty quickly as did the basil but everything else seems to be doing nothing. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs too wet or too hot or what the deal is , but it‚Äôs frustrating 


The next thing is, I have several plants that are getting too tall for my indoor set up and I really want to transplant them. I‚Äôve been trying to harden them off every day (the other day was really windy and one of my cucumbers stems got knocked/pinched and I didn‚Äôt notice until it was too late) so I‚Äôm wary of doing it again today as it‚Äôs really windy out. 

I‚Äôd like to at least transplant the corn, kale, spinach and tomatoes I have as they are running out of space in their pots. What I‚Äôm hoping to do it plant the tomatoes lower into the ground and build an embankment of soil around them and then rest glass over them balanced on the garden plots or up on logs if that is too low 

So for that, will that be enough to keep them warmer and protected from wind and will the glass not amplify the sun to the point it burns the leaves? Some of the leaves have been getting that sun burnt look here and there as I‚Äôve hardened them off but in my experience they recover from this. 

I‚Äôve also had a lot of trouble getting my eggplants and peppers to germinate this year and the few that have end up dying before they send up their first true set of leaves


I also have three sugar snap pea plants that are getting too tall for their pots and space and two royal beans I‚Äôd like to move out, but I‚Äôm not sure how well they‚Äôll take it 

I live in Massachusetts and it‚Äôs supposed to be colder and windy today and then warm up over the weekend and into next week but then drop to the low fifties for a high and low 30‚Äôs for a low probably over night by Wednesday next week so I‚Äôm not sure if I should just ride it out another week or so or if I should try putting them outside with the covers I described 

If you think I should keep them inside let me know what you think I should do to keep them happy and healthy with limited space while we wait...",6,/r/gardening/comments/fyhkk7/advice_on_germination_and_transplanting/

g032bo,gardening,Help keeping balcony plants alive in the Texas summer?,"So I'm a complete newbie with gardening. During the past two summers we were able to successfully grow a few varieties of peppers, we had a mint plant that survived two years, along with a few other stuff. My balconies face east (two face more south-east, one north-east). The problem is that it took SO much work to keep them alive through the summer. We were having to water everything 3-4 times a day, or they'd start drying and wilting pretty much immediately. We played around with putting them further back so they wouldn't get direct sun at all times, and it helped moderately (They eventually all died for unrelated reasons)

**This year we'd like to grow/buy new stuff (any kind, herbs, veggies, flowers, anything) that will survive the summer while not having to water** ***that*** **often. Anything that will prevent our balcony from looking like a barren plant-graveyard?**

g06xey,gardening,Beginner Gardener Looking for Advice,"\*\* PICTURES OF GARDEN \*\* [https://imgur.com/gallery/eSKQejz](https://imgur.com/gallery/eSKQejz) \*\* PICTURES OF GARDEN \*\*

Hello r/gardening! Hope you are all having a wonderful Easter.

Just want to get some advice for beginning my garden, and not use YouTube 100%...

I am about a mile away from the beach in Connecticut. This will be one of my first ventures into gardening with the time I have now that I am out of school. I have three beds on what used to be a bunch of weeds (ivy, onion grass, etc.) and some mulch. I dug up as much of the weeds as I could, and tilled with a shovel while adding some garden soil from a bag. I am going to add more soil and some manure to the beds, and probably a bit of mulch. I want to grow Cucumber where the trellis is, peppers in the center, and tomato in the right bed.

My concerns: - It was very weedy behind the garden, hoping the stray away.. Will keep an eye out for growth.

\- Sunlight is not the best there, with leaves on the trees the right bed will not get as much sun as the left and center bed.

\- Sowing outdoors...

\- Deer and my dogs wee/poop in the backyard.

What can I do that will make this garden yield the best results?

Edit: I recently got a job in Outdoor Garden at Lowe's and want to put that employee discount to use :)",6,/r/gardening/comments/g06xey/beginner_gardener_looking_for_advice/

g155qs,gardening,Persistent mealy bug infestation,"So I have been dealing with an indoor mealy bug infestation for a few weeks now. I have been using neem oil almost everyday on all plants and on (almost) every leaf. I do have a string of turtles who I assume is the reason I can't get it under control. It is pretty big and I have a hard time getting under the mass amount of leaves. Spraying every leaf is just not possible. I have also used alcohol and diatomaceous earth. I did run out of diatomaceous earth after an... incident. I have definitely killed most of them, but the last few evade me.

g17rdu,gardening,Questions about Neem oil concentrate and BT organic pesticide,"Hello, I am a novice when it comes to these pesticides and have some questions that, most likely due to my sloth, the label couldn't answer. 

So with the Neem oil concentrate I mixed 1 1/2 tablespoons with a gallon of tap water in a container and then transferred some of that mixture to a spray bottle and applied it to some cucumber sprouts in the yard to see how they reacted to it. I came back in the evening and they were and remain aphid free, however after allowing the mixture to rest all day and then using it on more plants and sprouts it's not achieving the same effect as the cucumber sprouts at all. This leads me to believe that either Neem oil decays over time in solution or the chlorine content of the tap water decayed the Neem oil. Does the concentrate need to be used immediately after mixing?

As for BT I have a similar question : Does the entire solution need to be used immediately after mixing and does tap water chlorine have an effect in the solution?

1. The soil in the garden bed, what should we do with it to make it healthy? Do we need new soil or should we just turn the soil over?

2. What plants can I plant now to get the soil prepared and ready for when I plant tomatoes in June? Should I plant some lettuce/leafy greens or peas/beans?

Could and animal be digging this? I don't see any evidence of digging (no mounds of dirt nearby), but there is often a 1-2"" diameter hole in the surface of the soil.

 Is it some sort of sink hole? This is near the front corner of my house, about six feet away from where the gas meter is. Could it be related? (I've never smelled natural gas or anything out there.) Or a water line leaking?

Who should I call first, a landscape company, pest control, or my natural gas provider? Any advice?",6,/r/gardening/comments/g2ggdr/animal_or_sink_hole_what_should_i_do/

g2js76,gardening,Tomato Seedlings Not Doing So Well,"Hey all, I'm still sort of new to growing pretty much anything and wanted to give tomato/pepper growing from seed a try since last year I had a pretty nice success with some plants I bought at a local nursery. Well, it's almost week 6 for these plants and for some reason all but one of the tomato (Super Sweet 100) plants are not growing well at all and keep dropping their lowest leaves. The peppers (Jalapeno Early) seem to be doing fine, however. I water them once every other day and fertilize with an organic liquid 3-2-2 fertilizer (just a small bit) once a week. I keep grow lights above about 18"" away and keep them on for about 14-16 hours a day. It's also always 70-78F during the day and 67-70F at night inside my house. My question is what I could adjust or try, so I can potentially revitalize the struggling plants?

g30nee,gardening,Raspberry help- sorry it's kinda long,"Howdy all, bought my first house a few years ago and had never tried growing anything before. The prior residents left a garden box in the back yard, so 2 years ago I cleaned it out and planted 2 raspberry stalks. One withered in the first summer, but the other survived and last year, 2 news stalks started to shoot up. This plant has not fruited in either year. This spring, the original plant I put in the ground dried out and never sprouted any leaves, the newer stalks are still growing and look okay to my untrained eye. My question is, do I need to do anything to promote berry production? Should I be worried that my original plants are now both dead? The box gets pretty good morning sun but by late afternoon the sun is on the other side of our house. Should I try to find a sunnier spot? Also, some of the leaves on the plants yellowed and curled a bit toward the end of the summer, not sure what that is.

What do you think is my best course of action? The cucumber, squash, pumpkin, and watermelon are my biggest concerns. I have them in egg cartons and peat pots. Their roots have started to coil in the trays below them. 

I guess I'm wondering if they would benefit and survive a transplant to a larger container (like Solo cups)? I'm still weeks away from my safe transplant date (May 19th). Can they stay put or is my root issue a issue I need to address ASAP?

g48j3v,gardening,New to propagating! Advice please? (Basil),"I'm new(ish) to both reddit and gardening so sorry if this is a a strange question or not formatted correctly! I watched a video on growing basil from cuttings and was inspired to give it a go after many failed half attempts in the past. I took some cuttings and although some leaves weren't in the best shape, they've actually grown some roots and stayed alive over the past week! Considering I didn't have a grow light/heat mat like the video, they're doing quite good. Needless to say I'm happy so far, but I have some questions as some videos/books are saying conflicting things.

Firstly, am I correct in keeping the basil rooting for a bit longer in water before potting them? One video had them doing this for just under 3 weeks, and the roots were huge, but I've read wildly different things (e.g. they shouldn't be grown more than a couple of cm before potting). My cutting's roots are about 5cm at the moment.

Also, a book I'm reading says plants rooted in water get so used to it that you have to trim them before potting. Is this true? 

Also, I was thinking of boiling some of my rain water and adding raw honey to it to boost the rooting, as I am avoiding more unnatural fertilisers (1. because it's an edible plant, and 2. because of shopping in this pandemic). 

Third, When I hopefully pot them I am going to try and find an organic, peat free blend. A video I watched used peaty soil/compost to help them grow though - is there any way I can improve the likelihood of my basil growing without using a peaty blend? 

Sorry for the long post! I would love to hear all your opinions on these things and if you have any experience in the stuff mentioned above. Thanks for reading, any advice appreciated!",6,/r/gardening/comments/g48j3v/new_to_propagating_advice_please_basil/

I'm wanting to plant some veggies (I'm thinking lots of yummy bell peppers), though I know absolutely nothing about doing that.  I really want to learn, but I'm going to need motivation first and that's going to involve preparing this site for planting, if it's even a good idea. 

I live in the Bay Area (California) and have a (possibly) really nice little place for planting in my backyard.   I have two big questions first:

* https://i.imgur.com/lf0GHl8.jpg
* https://i.imgur.com/c4GiMYU.jpg

1.  Is this a bad place to plant vegetables like peppers n such?  Is it deep enough, big enough, etc?  It -should- get a reasonable amount of sunlight per day.. but how much do I have to worry about the house/fence blocking the sun?  

2. The current dirt in there is ROCK HARD solid.  Should I just get it wet and dig it up out so I can buy some nice soil?

Sorry, these are probably the most basic questions ever.. but I'm gonna need to get motivated by clearing this and THEN do mah learnin' :)

g54rtk,gardening,Is flexing in raised garden bed okay?,"Hi everyone. I appreciate your advice here and this is my first time gardening and I'm a bit nervous.

After posting on here with my plans, I built a 4'x8' raised garden bed, 8"" tall, using 1"" thick cedar. After putting the box together, I put 2""x2"" posts at each corner and at the midway point (4') lengthwise and screwed into that.

Despite all that structure, I am able to flex the wood with my hands, even on the width side on the 4' sections.

Is that normal? I'm afraid I'll fill it with soil and it'll bow sooner or later. I spent so much on this cedar (almost $200 for 3 beds) and I'm afraid it was a waste!

g5dj8b,gardening,To DIY or get professional help?,"This 30 square meter patch of lawn had been flooded last year and seriously overgrown by weeds. After cutting down the growth and removing some weeds, the soil is pretty bare and cracking dry. It also is not very leveled and higher than the patio. (not necessarily a problem for us)

This is a rented property and we just want a decent lawn for later this summer and next couple of years, nothing crazy.

What should we do with this lawn? Since we are in lockdwown anyway, we were going to overseed/reseed it ourselves after making the soil a bit more moist and removing some of the remaining weeds.

The plan was to water, aerate and rake/clean debris, fertilise then a few days later over-seed and continue to water when needed. We are in England and it's been a pretty dry sunny spring.

We only have a basic rake, fork and shovel. **Is this a job for professionals or could we achieve a decent lawn with the above? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.**

That paired with all the recently melted snow was apparently enough to get my three hydrangeas starting to bud. A week later the temp dropped well below freezing for a few nights and when I went to check on them I noticed every bud had shriveled brown and died. The next week we had more sun and I noticed a few buds on each but only down by the roots. 

I checked the forecast and noticed we were going to get more cold nights plus some snow so I wrapped them in plastic and covered them with boxes to keep the few buds from dying. After the snow melted I removed the makeshift greenhouses and was happy to see the buds still green but, now that it's been a week with no freezing temps I'm not seeing any more bud growth anywhere on the plants, just the 8 or so from a couple weeks ago.

Will new buds replace the ones that died from the first round of cold weather or are they pretty much done for?

I've ordered a refurbished whiskey half-barrel that I plan to move it into.

I think I know what I need to do now after a bit of research (drill drainage holes in the bottom, cover holes with wire mesh, have barrel lifted above the ground, treat the wood with apple vinegar and put a waterproof coat on it etc).

One thing I'm not sure about is whether or not I need to line the inside of the barrel with plastic liner? It seems people do it, but I've read a few comments from people saying that the plastic won't stay in tact for long. If so is there any point in doing it? If there is a benefit of doing it, what kind of plastic sheet is best, polythene, PVC or something else?

My other question is, will the tree happily grow to the extent that the barrel size allows and then just stop growing? 

It would be good to hear any tips/suggestion/common pitfalls from people who have done something like this before.

I am wondering the best way to grow the seeds once I put them in a solo cup after they sprout and not my herb garden. My indoor herb garden only holds a spot for 2 seeds, so it doesn't get me anywhere if I want to grow multiple things.

Should I just place them in sunlight with a dome overtop? I plan on transferring most of my vegetables outside once weather becomes nicer and after last frost. I hear so many different things so I came reddit for the rescue.

I'm posting in here to get some insight and recommendations from more experienced gardeners on my first ever fruit tree ! A little info for you all about my ""garden"" space and requirements for the tree:

\- Tree **must do well in a container** since I don't have a yard  
\- I have a **small balcony** (about 5x12). It is a roofless balcony and gets **sun for about 6-7 hours from 7ish-1pm**, since it's faces 60 degrees East/Northeast  
\- Currently live near the beach in Southern California, **hardiness zone 10b**  
\- The hardier/more durable the tree the better

Any and all help is appreciated. Feel free to also recommend sites or nurseries that ship trees. Or if you've bought trees from Home Depot share what your experience was like and if you'd buy from them again (there is one next to my house).

g7trqg,gardening,Bindweed is everywhere!,"I inherited a small garden when we bought a new house 2 years ago. I let the garden go for a year to see what was already in place (we bought in October so I couldn't tell what would come back). I pulled weeds and kept it as tidy as I could. 

Then, I realized that the previous owner had mulched but left the mulch bags underneath; maybe as a form of weed control? I pulled that up and my fight with the bindweed truly began. 

It. Is. EVERYWHERE!

I carefully try to pull it up, digging lightly around it, to try getting as much of the root as possible. Just when I think an area is good, 3 more leaves break the surface again. I want to plant vegetables here so I don't want to use chemicals but I'm feeling like I have no other options. In one hour of weeding, I can pull up like 50 feet of roots from this weed.

The Apple tree is smaller than the pear tree even though it‚Äôs older and has never had fruit.

I got:

* Mint (Mentha, altho the bag doesn't really elaborate on that. it just says... ""menta"" which is mint in Spanish).
* Cactus (The bag says it contains a mix of different types of cacti, so... there's that)
* Tall Sunflower ( ***Helianthus giganteus.*** Luckily this one is pretty specific. )

So, my grandma and I are going to plant them, I have 0 experience when it comes to plants but I really want to give it a try and this is the first time she will try to get a plant from the seed intentionally (we have a papaya, and we had some awesome and sweet fruit out of it last year, but... that was kind of an accident? haha). 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to ask for any advice you could give, like... methods to make them ensure most of them germinate, or something like that, I've seen a method which uses a paper towel, is that a good idea for the seeds I have?. I really feel kinda lost here! So, any advice would be pretty useful.

g90mb0,gardening,Yikes! I am new...is this lavender dead?,"Early last summer we purchased two healthy lavender plants.   They are of the English variety. We harvested/pruned them in the fall and they did overwinter outside, tucked next to our home.  For the pruning we followed the common advice we found in trimming it back, but definitely not going back to the woody portion of the plant. For the winter, they were lightly covered in one of those fine clothe bush/plant coverings to help them through it. I should mention, we do live in Southeastern Wisconsin (zone 5b) and are very new to all things plants and gardening.

This is what the poor fellows look like now. Very dead looking. There is some sprouting going on the soil, but I'm not too certain that those are anything other than weeds. So, are these guys dead? Is there anything I  can try to help revive them?

While in high school, I worked on a farm for three years, but in the last two years, I haven't gardened at all. I didn't have the resources or space. I've recently moved into a quiet little street in North Philadelphia, and it has enormous scope to garden in the front and the back! I'm still shaky on the resources, but I want to give it a go. With the stay at home order and a little bit of income, I'd like to begin anew on my gardening journey. I ordered some veggie, flower, and some canary yellow melon seeds offline from MIGardener, and I'll be ready to go in about a week or two, or so I hope. The thing is I want to plant a few dwarf fruit trees and maybe some berry bushes as well in the front and the back, but I'm not sure what to put in. I was thinking maybe a few raspberries and a pear or plum tree or two, but for someone who's hasn't gardened in a few years, is it too much? I feel obligated to say while I haven't gardener in a few years, my interest has always been there, and I've spent a lot of time on YouTube following other people's gardens, etc. Any advice would be great!

I now have a trash bag full of the stuff to use for fert.

Wanted to include it in my garden bed for veggies (mixed in with the soil), but have no idea what ratio I should be using here. Since its not store bought or anything I have no idea what the NPK or anything is so I'm flying a bit blind.

I literally just finished planting everything. 


2 tomatoes, 1green bell pepper. These are from seedlings.


From seeds, 2 lavender pots, and 2 cucumbers.


And in a giant pot/bucket I planted 4 halved strawberries. 


The cucumbers, lavender, and strawberries were planted in halved toilet paper rolls.


In each hole I placed coffee grounds, egg shells, and Epsom salt/sugar mixture I got from pinterest. On the top soil around the plants I sprinkled more coffee grounds and eggshells. They've been watered and are getting sunlight.

ftw9ez,gardening,Did I kill my strawberry plants?,"Hey all, very novice gardener here. 
About 4 weeks ago I planted some bare root pine berries (white strawberry variety) in some basic potting soil in a new garden bed. They seemed to do well with 4 of the 6 plants shooting out new leaves within a week. 
Unfortunately last weekend my husband decided I had to move them as they were too close to our buried internet cable (oops). 
So I dug them up and moved them to a new location with mostly compost as the soil. I wasnt too careful about keeping the roots wet but did water them once I was finished.  

Now 3 of the 4 that had sprouted have had the leaves die off!

Of course both were planted and cared for identically, but the lemon is doing poorly. Similarly the grass on one side of the lemon tree is doing poorly while the grass everywhere is thriving. Does anyone have any idea what this may potentially be?

When I first moisten the soil to put my seeds in the trays, the soil is almost always hydrophobic - meaning my water bunches up on top and won't go beyond that barrier. I generally mix it up with my finger, but these are shallow trays and I'd rather not do that 100 times if I can avoid it.

I'm using quality soil (happy frog) but it may be a little dry due to overwintering in an open bag.

Any suggestions?",5,/r/gardening/comments/fvh15c/hydrophobic_soil_and_starting_seedlings/

Edit again: more pics of some leaves I picked off for better detail on the problem https://imgur.com/a/kbFpjlF

I have a wonderful pomegranate in a large container outside. It gets 6+ hours of sun a day here in Los Angeles. It's the trees second year with me since I bought it. Last year was rough for it since I didn't water it as much as I should have, especially in the summer but overall I look after it. 

The problem is the leaves just aren't in the best shape, and it hasn't set any flowers yet (Oddly enough my parents got two pomegranates for their house 6 months ago and those two trees already bloomed, albeit theirs are planted in the ground.)

I want to add it's been cold here in LA, been getting a lot of rain, temps have been low (for us). I showed pictures of the plant to the guys at my local Armstrong garden and they just keep saying it's cause it's been cold but I dunno about all that. 

I take care of the thing, neem oil, insecticidal soaps and all that jazz. I'm much better about watering it now. I put all kinds of nice fertilizers in their, Down to Earth brand acid mixes and bio live and what not. I sprayed a epsom salt dilution on the leaves to help with magnesium intake, incase that was the issue. 

But if anyone out there knows what could be causing this, I'd love to hear from you. I keep a close eye on it and I don't think it's an insect issue. I think it's either a disease or a deficiency in it's vitamins and minerals. 

Anyway, thanks hope to hear from you!

fwocgp,gardening,Help identifying rash-causing plant (poison oak?),"Hi folks,

I am barely knowledgeable at all in the world of gardening, but I thought I'd turn to this subreddit for some possible advice. 

We have what I thought was generic ivy over one side of our backyard fencing. It had gotten rather overgrown, so two weekends ago, I took some shears and pruned it back roughly. I wore gloves, but a short sleeve shirt and shorts. A few days later, I developed spotty rashes on my forearms and shins, and I presume it must have been from contact with this plant. I cut out some ground vines, as well as pruning back the ivy.

I have a couple young ones that spend a lot of time in the yard, so if this identifiable as poison oak or other, I'd love to know and clear out the hazard. I'm not confident I can identify whatever it is (if anything).

Thanks in advance for any input you can provide.

I have read that berry bushes like well drained soil but not sure exactly what that means and it seems hard to judge it in this season. 

I have blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries coming. I'm in Zone 6. The bushes are bare-root, about 1 foot tall. 

I wanted to plant them along my fence line but after a rainfall last night, this area is definitely not dry. My soil is heavy in clay and it is kind of just muddy over there.

I don't want to plant these in planters or pots - looking for a natural look to some extent. I do have the option maybe to plant these in a raised garden bed, but it would only raise them up by 6"" - would that be enough to help the soil drain in these circumstances?

What else should I know? I also read they like acidic soil so I have bought some soil acidifier from Lowes.

fx8a5a,gardening,New garden question,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

So im kinda new to gardening in general, every year i plant a couple plants from the farmers market in some pots that i put out in front of my house but all growing up my father had a huge garden in his front yard that i would like to emulate on a smaller scale. 

So since we are all in quarantine i decided to give myself this project and i have a few questions. First i have pretty much dug up my whole back hard and borrowed my fathers tiller to get rid of all the old tree roots and huge rocks that were scattered throughout the yard. My question is, is it safe to go straight to planting a garden this year in dirt that may not be the best quality? I bought my house about 2 years ago and my neighbor made an off hand comment to me as i was working last week that he would never eat anything grown out of that ground since the previous owners had about 4 dogs that they let just take control of the back yard, (I found about two huge garbage bags of cow bones buried throughout this yard. So imagine that the dogs were also shitting all throughout without ever being picked up.

&amp;#x200B;

The house was vacant for about 1.5 years before i bought it and i have had it for 2 so is that enough time to say the dirt should be good to plant in again or would planting something like sunflowers for a season be a good idea? 

&amp;#x200B;

Again i am new to this whole thing, is this something i should be worried about or is it a non issue?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!",5,/r/gardening/comments/fx8a5a/new_garden_question/

fx9rqn,gardening,New home. Stoney backyard. Total newbie,"Hi folks.  
I moved into a new house last year, and I have been thinking of getting my backyard professionally done for the longest time, but we never got around to it.  
I have attached photos, but basically, there is grass, but its covered with messy stones and pebbles, to the point that it actually hurts to walk on it with slippers. There is also some random weeds which I have attached photos of. One weird issue is that the backyard isn't even flat: It slopes downhill about 2/3rds of the way.  
This was supposed to be the backyard for a new house, and even the person doing my snagging warned me that the state of the backyard is absolutely dismal, but the builders refused to do anything.  
Some months ago, the grass got really big and messy and I just got a lawnmover to cut it down.  


Anyway, I am pretty new to all this, and we are not even extremely sure what we want. At some point, we would like to keep a toolshed for the lawnmover, a bicycle and maybe a few tools. Apart from that, we'd want to have some sort of stone paving and garden furniture somewhere. Some planters for flowers and vegetables or something. But I don't think I am capable enough to get all this done on my own right now. For now, I have lots of time in my hand stuck at home, and I just want to make the lawn more walkable and pleasant with actual nice grass, and I don't know where to start.  


Like I said, I have moved the grass down quite a bit, but I need the extension box to cover the full lawn. Today, I went around and collected a lot of stones and put them in a bag.  


Do I need to rake down towards the end of the ground to make it more level with something like a landscaping rake? Do I need to cover this up with better top soil, or should I just add fertiliser and seed? Or should I just go about collecting rocks by hand, and using a small spade to dig up weeds?

fxd3dy,gardening,Brain Picking! Zone 5b perennial strip garden,"Hello all!

I'm not necessarily new to gardening in general. However flowers/shrubs are a bit different than my veggies. :) 

There's so many varieties and types out there I was hoping some of you could share your personal favorites for a strip I plan on putting down in the next couple of weeks. As stated I'm zone 5b. The area I'm planting is partial sun right now (next to a garage, but by 2p it's sun all the way until about 8p). Moving into the fall it'll be a bit more partial shade. Strip is 22'x2' so I have plenty of room for a fun variety!

Anyway hoping you guys can share favorites with different bloom periods so I can have something sweet to look at through the season. I'm very fond of hostas and really like the fire &amp; ice variety so I know I'll have one of those. And if anyone has any tips or tricks on planting these bulbs please do tell. I'm looking up everything I need to know, but I think we can all agree experience surpasses what one can simply read. Also, ask any clarifying questions if need be, and thank you all so much for helping make my back yard beautiful!!",5,/r/gardening/comments/fxd3dy/brain_picking_zone_5b_perennial_strip_garden/

This is a great idea, whether the motivation is helping bees, improving pollinator resources, restoring habitat, or even just for the sake of beauty.

The process is more complicated that sowing vegetables, however, so a primer can help set you up for success. The following link may not be the best for where you live, but it's a comprehensive source to help you understand all the important aspects involved in the process so you can get started on the right foot. [https://www.canr.msu.edu/nativeplants/](https://www.canr.msu.edu/nativeplants/)

There may be recommendations better suited for you if you are outside the Great Lakes region. To find such information, try searching the phrase ""Native plants site:edu"" or ""Native wildflowers site:edu"" with your state's name placed in front (i.e. ""New Mexico Native Plants site:edu""). This should help you find quality Agricultural Extension information for your area.

fzeg3r,gardening,Why can you revive plants such as green onion but not others,"For example, it's common to regrow green onions in water. How can they be harvested and then spend all the time in the chain from farm to household and still be able to be revived, yet I assume you couldn't do such a thing for a squash plant. I guess it's relevant to the fact that it's a green vegetable, i.e. if the leaves/green area is destroyed its useless, or maybe because spring onion is a bulb (barely), therefore the plant goes into a sort of dormancy -- or are they chemically treated to preserve?

&amp;#x200B;

Are these permanently lost? I hope not. Blooms are 6"" wide (!) pale yellow and white with a picoteed edge. WANT WANT WANT

They're an Iceland-type poppy originally cultivated by Erma Westcott of Portland, Oregon. She bred these poppies in her backyard over 50 years before her death in 1982. She handed them off to Thompson &amp; Morgan and insisted on their name.

SSE doesn't carry them, and Portland Nursery's website doesn't mention them. These flowers are stellar performers west of the Cascade mountains...any Pacific Northwest gardeners have a line on these poppies? Thanks!

g0ftfn,gardening,"Looking for a few pointers towards growing vegetables at home, utter newbie and struggling with basics!","***Our situation and what's available***

My wife and I live in England, have a house with a patio and no garden.  
With the quarantine situation (and a baby on the way) we would like to plant some vegetables and herbs to supplement our food supply.  
Our back patio has about 7x7ft of free space with relatively good exposure to the sun (6 or more hours of sunlight a day if not overcast).

We have a small conservatory which offers some protection from the elements but without a great deal of free space for planters, maybe 3.5 square feet but NARROW as it would be on what's essentially a windowsill.

***What we've found so far***

We are looking at grow-bags for tomatoes, which would sit comfortably outside if they can grow through a British spring and summer without needing the protection of a conservatory/greenhouse.

For that we understand that we would need tomato plants to root into the growbag but we are struggling to find young plants due to the quarantine and related shortages.  If we're growing from seeds we've literally never done this so I'm not sure how to go about doing this.  I understand we need to develop the seeds but I have no idea how.

We're also looking at growbags (big 40-50 liter, open-topped bags with drainage at the bottom) to grow potatoes and carrots, possibly cucumbers as well.  
I understand that there are quite a few things we might need to grow vegetables in such a way, the biggest confusion is what feed to get, what potting mix/potting soil/potting compost we need to have and what variation for each vegetable.

***Biggest points of confusion***

I still can't figure out the different soil or compost mixes, as well as what ""feed"" to add for each vegetable.  I believe that for some vegetables, such as carrots, we may be starting a little late in the season, but haven't been able to find a good source of information that's relevant to growing in pots or planters in the UK.

Essentially, any tips or advice, or even just good sources we can use for more learning would be really appreciated!  Thanks for your help in advance!

I've been thinking about switching to Creeping thyme for ground cover to simply need to mow far less often and read it can be a faster spreader and choke out other plants easily. Would it win out over the Virginia creeper?",5,/r/gardening/comments/g0wix8/virginia_creeper_vs_creeping_thyme/

Every year though I struggle with finding annual flowers that are truly capable of surviving/thriving in direct sunlight - even when some flowers come with raja staring full sunlight. My deck is west facing and receives zero shade throughout the day. Summers in my area of the world can definitely get hot so I also recognize that some flowers may simply struggle with such intense, non stop sunlight and heat. 

The last couple of years I made a list of the flowers that did the best and of course my list is now missing.

When I opened the bag I noticed the smell (it reminded me of horse poop and sea bird poop). I read the label and it has  added fertilizers: bat guano, poultry manure and kelp meal. Do you use this potting mix? Is it normal for it to smell? Does the smell go away? A quick google search shows people saying that Kellogg uses human poop  (so gross!) in small quantities and sewer water... is this true? Will it attract bugs and critter with the smell? Is there another potting mix you can recommend for mint, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and scallions? This is my first trial at gardening and I am trying to figure out the basics.

g1ydyt,gardening,Advice on replacing a wall garden,"My wife and I live in a condo with a patio being the only outdoor space. We wanted to keep it nice and green so we put out some flower boxes and hung some baskets and purchased one of those basic fabric pocket wall planters off Amazon. The flower boxes and baskets do all right, most likely because they can get rained on occasionally, but twice now we've replaced the plants in the wall garden and they've not done well, so I want to do some research and find a solution. I know that part of my problem is picking the wrong plants and part is doing a poor job of watering.

[https://imgur.com/7MN1Bsv](https://imgur.com/7MN1Bsv)

I live in Seattle and the patio faces East. Because of the roof the wall only gets direct sunlight between 3-6, so I have been trying to find plants that can tolerate both the climate year round and little direct sun. The ones that seem best are vines and ferns, which are great, but I would like to add a little color if I can, without it looking dead during the autumn half of the year.

Second is the watering issue. It's a patio so there is no available water source. We need to fill a watering can in the kitchen and take it out there at least five times for the wall alone, so I wanted to set up an automatic watering system, or even better would be a hydroponic system that would only require draining and refilling a reservoir a few times per month. I'm fairly handy and even have access to a 3D printer, so I feel like this is doable, however I do not know how the plants will do outdoors, or which ones to pick that can tolerate the same watering schedule. I was actually looking at these modules when I decided to write this post:

g2z91u,gardening,Marigold and other basic flower planting,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm a total beginner gardener looking to get into it while I‚Äôm home with my parents in warm middle GA during the lockdown. I am actually moving to Columbus, OH in August, but I figured now might be a good time to practice caring for a small plant that I could either take with me (preferably), or serve as a learning experience for growing more there. 

I‚Äôve been looking at both indoor and outdoor plants (we have a decent backyard, but would prefer to bring an indoor planter or similar to Ohio with me for a little slice of home!), and I‚Äôve seen that African violets and orchids are two of the easier indoor houseplants. I love them both, but I also came upon the Marigold in a search for ‚Äúeasygoing‚Äù plants. I really find them beautiful, meaningful (one of my favorite songs is about them!), and the planting period lined up well with this time of year! I do know that you‚Äôre supposed to ‚Äúlove what you grow,‚Äù more than ‚Äúgrow what you love,‚Äù but this seems like a manageable plant that I also love. My goal for this is simply to grow it for the joy of cultivating something beautiful and learning a new skill, so I want to prioritize learning as well. 

I apologize if this is against the rules, but the sheer volume of material and variability in different plans has confused me, so I was wondering if I could ask a few basic questions:

1. Of the three plants I listed (African violet, orchids, marigolds), which would you start out with?

2. I‚Äôm planning to grow whichever flower I choose from seeds, just to see more of the growth. How much more difficult am I making the process by doing so?

3. Because of my living situation, I could be packing up and moving away from my parent‚Äôs house to an apartment with much less yard space. How possible is it to move plants grown outdoors? 

4. (A dumb but general one), I keep seeing that ‚Äúindirect sunlight‚Äù is best for some plants. That would mean like shaded areas, correct? Or windowsills? When using indoor lighting, are we talking about HID lights or are fluorescent lights also effective?

5. If you have any recommendations on reasonably sized pots or planters I‚Äôd love to hear :), this is also something I‚Äôm researching though.

Again, apologies if this post is demanding too many answers- I would normally go to Lowe‚Äôs and talk to a worker, but with the virus here it‚Äôs harder to come by advice on all these small things, and I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out how to enter into this big world of gardening without getting overwhelmed. 

If you have any advice at all to give, I‚Äôd be super grateful. I want to make this a lifelong pursuit, so I‚Äôd love advice on expanding. If I could grow all three flowers, I will! Thanks for your help in advance.",5,/r/gardening/comments/g2z91u/marigold_and_other_basic_flower_planting/

This is my first year starting seedlings, last year was my first year growing anything from plants. I planted the seeds on Sunday afternoon (Easter).  5 days later I'm already seeing a ton of growth but because they look stringy I'm not at all excited. 

I have 2 types of tomatoes (beefsteak, Jersey devil), 2 types of sweet peppers, Brussels sprouts, and marigolds. They were planted in generic potting mix. Some was years old, and dried out, so I rehydrated it back to normal texture and then added some water soluble tomato food to add back any missing nutrients. I used a popsicle stick with a mark to make holes but maybe they still weren't deep enough. I was worried it was too deep but clearly I know nothing. 

We're in a basement in 6b, so I used covers, and a room heater instead of seed mats because we're trying to save money. The marigolds popped up 2 days ago (seriously??), and so did just a few spots of white fluffy mold so I removed the covers. With the space heater, the tops of the cells dry out quite quickly so I find myself bottom watering nearly every day. Some days if it isn't super bone dry I'll gently top water. An avid gardener in the family uses a two-light t8 fluorescent shop light setup and it works fine so that's what I opted to try out as grow lights this year. They're on from 8am to 10pm. I notice the seedlings on the edges bending towards it every morning so I try to switch the tray positions to alternate the direction and encourage them to be at least a little upright. Maybe that's not wise, though. 

The marigolds immediately smacked of legginess, even though I've never grown them before. But because they LITERALLY sprung from the Earth overnight I tried not to worry too much and give them the light they needed. They have light, air circulation,  water, and warmth. I'll only keep the heater in there until all my seeds have germinated, and it's only on long enough at a time to make it nice and warm in there.

My tomatoes began sprouting yesterday morning (seriously?!?!) And they looked all bendy and week. Now they too are learning up towards the light. They're really stretchy it looks like. They also have purple stems, and when they first emerged their leaves were a yellow ish color  Also 4 or 5 of my tomatoes are carrying the seed out of the cells with them!!! Help!

g388ni,gardening,My first potato harvest. Some concerns though.,"So I started a veggie garden back in January of this year (2020). I have never really gardened before so this is most definitely a learning experience. Decided to harvest one plant due to the leaves and stalks turning yellow-green. To my understanding it was time especially since its been approximately 4 months. Upon harvesting these potato plants today I had three that looked really different then the rest. Unfortunately I don't remember which plant it came from. All potatoes were completely covered but it does look like there is a slight green tint to these odd ones. I would like to point out that earlier in the previous months an animal had dug in my garden and destroyed one of my plants. I do not know if this had an effect on this harvest or not.

https://imgur.com/a/jaTeiQL

I have been looking online and can not seem to isolate an answer, with picture to confirm. The odd potatoes do not smell different but one did have exposed flesh. This is the only thing i can think may have caused this. With that being said I will probably just wait for these to sprout eyes and use them as seed potatoes along with the rest of the harvest.

Could anyone give me any tips/advise/direction?

Going to get some two by sixes and make some raised beds to fill with a 50/50 topsoil and compost mixture with some perlite and other goodies mixed in for our first big gardening project here.

Now we really love things like tomatoes and cucumbers and so I plan on putting some t-posts up and attaching some rolled cattle barding to it as a trellis, basically a little chain link fence cutting the bed in two.

On each side of the trellis we'll then have two rows of twelve 1ftx1ft squares to plant in.  My big question is, when planning out crops, will I be able to plant (for example) 24 tomato plants in that bed (guide showing 1 tomato plant for each 1 ft square) and line both sides of the trellis/fence with those plants?

Or should I be planning for 12 in that box and the other 36 squares should be plants that don't need a trellis?

Does that make sense?  Really new to gardening and trying to plan out the materials order and what seedlings we'll need and just want to know how many climbers I'll want to order.

g3u8l2,gardening,"Well, my first shot at a vegetable garden looks to be a failure. What did I do wrong?","I‚Äôve finally found myself with some free time and decided to start a small vegetable garden this year. I spent a few days researching and then a few more building and getting it setup. I planted the vegetables last night and woke up this morning to find almost all of them completely wilted over, leaves and even stems. It‚Äôs bad and I‚Äôm sure they are all going to die here shortly.

I‚Äôd love some insight, perhaps someone knows where I may have gone wrong. Here are some key details:

- I have 3 2.5‚Äôx8‚Äô beds positioned to get full sun. 

- Each bed has approximately 8 inches of planting soil on top of manually tilled local dirt.

- I‚Äôm in Southwest Idaho and the growing season has begun as far as I know. It‚Äôs 70 degrees f today. 

- I planted peppers, tomatoes, zucchini, cucumbers and some herbs. All have wilted badly overnight and were looking really healthy when I got them in the ground. They are spaced about 18-24 inches apart as directed on the tags.

- They‚Äôve had plenty of water, both from a lawn sprinkler zone that hits them as well as manual soaking with the hose. One of my concerns here is that perhaps I over watered? I wouldn‚Äôt think overwater would kill this quickly though.

- As mentioned above, some lawn sprinklers hit them so I wonder if perhaps the pressure from the heads damaged the plants. I need to adjust the direction of some heads and may install a drip system later.

- I fertilized with a 4-4-2 organic mix but forgot to put it in while planing and just put it on top of the soil. I probably used 1lb but honestly I winged it. I also dusted the plants before knowing this could cause over saturation of nutrients and burn the leaves. Perhaps the fertilizer is killing them since it fell on the leaves too? Right now, the fertilizer is my main suspect.

I‚Äôm really at a loss here but am sure I‚Äôm missing something obvious based on how quickly they wilted.

g44wlh,gardening,Friendly way to rid weeds,"Hi all, recently joined this sub!

I just wanted to ask for some advice, relatively new to gardening and I want to get rid of weeds with minimum harm to insects etc.

I know the 100% friendliest way is to dig them up, but I want to get rid of weeds growing between patio slabs so this isn't really possible. *however* I believe I have bees and such amongst/under them too. I'm happy with my garden friends living there and don't want to harm any of them but want rid of the weeds.. How?! Any help is much appreciated and if there's hard truths that it's not possible, I will accept that, I just wanted to ask those with more experience for any advice.

Thank you all for any guidance on this!",5,/r/gardening/comments/g44wlh/friendly_way_to_rid_weeds/

g4sht0,gardening,Critique my idea,"I'm a complete newbie at this and my wife and I got an idea to create a garden.  For many reasons we don't need to get into, we need a raised garden and have devised a plan.

[This](https://i.imgur.com/TM8UELG.jpg) is a sketch of the idea.  Its internal dimensions are 4' x 5' x 33"" tall.  

At the bottom I'll be creating a 6"" high wicking reservoir using a combination of 6 mil plastic sheeting, perforated drainage pipe, and rocks.  There will be a PVC pipe coming up the side with a garden hose attachment to fill when needed.  That will be covered with a couple layers of weed barrier.

On top of that will be 24"" of organic gardening soil.  This leaves 3"" of rim from top of the garden to the soil.  

The two side posts are 8' in the air that we will be able to use to hang things like string lights or whatever.

The side panels are 2x6 and will be treated with tung oil prior to being assembled.  

Anyone see any glaring flaws in this, or have any ideas to make it better?  We're going to start with one, but plan on having three of these.",5,/r/gardening/comments/g4sht0/critique_my_idea/

I have 3 small flower beds running along the front of a house I just bought that are overrun with weeds, and have clay not far under the soil. I would like to plant some bushes that run along the house to break up the amount of bricks in the home. The only problem is that I have no idea what the most efficient way to prep is, and the articles I've read give somewhat contradictory information.

Should I use chemicals to kill the weeds? Can I just rent a rototiller from Home Depot and go nuts with it to tear the weeds out, and then put some fresh soil or mulch on top to make it look nice? Anything specific to clay soil that I need to know when planting a bush so it doesn't just die immediately? Is gardening fabric actually useful, or is it a scam that has no effect? I have pictures of the area too if that makes it easier to lend me some help.

g5r25s,gardening,How late can I start tomato plants?,"(Hardiness zone 8b)

Hello! 

I‚Äôm new to gardening and getting a semi-late start this season. I‚Äôve researched the best time to plant things by seed and when to transplant for my zone, but I‚Äôm wondering how flexible those dates can be! I wouldn‚Äôt expect to get an optimized harvest, but would it be unreasonable to start tomatoes from seed indoors now if they‚Äôd be harvestable a month before the first frost? Will their vegetative and reproductive growth periods be wonky because of the high summer temps? 

Thanks! 

P.s. I know it‚Äôs not recommended for newbies to grow tomatoes from seed, but it‚Äôs so inexpensive that I figured I‚Äôd try! I won‚Äôt be able to transplant anything till I move to my new home a month from now anyway, so I figured can buy established plants then if my seeds fail)",5,/r/gardening/comments/g5r25s/how_late_can_i_start_tomato_plants/

g7h4or,gardening,"Growing veggies in containers - wicking pot, grow bag or ... ?","Hi all! I typically grow veggies in the ground, or in raised beds. I've never really grown in pots/containers except for the occasional extra veggie start that I had laying around. This year I'd like to try some tomatoes, eggplant and zucchini on my porch because I've filled up all my raised beds already! I've been researching various containers and I see a few options:

1. Regular pot with holes at the bottom, with drip system.
2. Home-made wicking pot (Something like  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzlnf6Q9IYw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzlnf6Q9IYw) )
3. Grow bags ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2Bp-B-1GW0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2Bp-B-1GW0) ) With either a drip system, or wicking as seen in the video.

I'm wondering if anyone has tried all three, and if you have a favorite? I'm in Colorado so it's pretty dry, we can have big storms in the afternoon and it gets very hot during the days but stays cool (usually) at night. I'll be planting about 15-20 containers, so maybe I'll try a few different options and test them out myself! So far the grow bags seem pretty cheap &amp; easy and the wicking pots seem like a PITA to build. 

I'm also wondering - do you change the soil in the pots each year? Or just add more nutrients?

I have a miniature lemon tree, not sure what variety. Lemons grow to be around 2cm in diameter and are extremely juicy. 

We live in Dubai. We bought it a few months ago during winter so the weather has been very mild and pleasant and is now starting to warm up a bit. 

It lives on the balcony, outside. It‚Äôs very dusty. It gets about 2 hours of weak sunlight a day. 

Initially produced a lot of lemons and continued doing so for a while. Now all the original lemons have gone and new ones are starting to grow. 

The lemons seem to be growing fine but the leaves look terrible. The older ones are striped with black lines parallel to the vein, or curling, or brown at the tips, or turning yellow. Almost all of them have these tiny black spots on the back. 

New leaves are growing quite rapidly but we are worried that there is something really wrong with our tree and that it will spread to the new leaves/lemons. 

Can anyone help diagnose?",5,/r/gardening/comments/g7ofwk/whats_wrong_with_my_mini_lemon_tree_pics_for/

I have Glen ample(summer) and autumn bliss(autumn) raspberries.
I have had them there for around 7 years.
Each December I prune them back according to the type that they are, summer keep old canes topped at about 5foot high, autumn I cut down to about 200mm from ground. 

Last December I pruned them all back down to about 200mm as we are selling the house, and wanted the place to look tidy.

Well, we are still in the house, due to lock down, noticed that the autumn bliss have grown as usual, but this year, they are growing fruit already, and it's only April?  I can confirm they are still autumn bliss canes, as huey have thorns, and the Glen ample are thornless. 

Also, my Glen ample are not growing at all, as expected, as I removed nearly all last year's canes.

We moved last year, and have these bushes in the front.  These bushes have red or pin flowers, and looked really nice.  I was wondering if I'm supposed to cut some of the branches?  It's still early spring in Minnesota, so they haven't leafed yet.  But it looks very brambly.

I've had bushes in the past that weren't healthy because it had too many dead branches inside, and only the leafs were growing on the outside.  Almost like...matted hair on a uncombed dog, if that makes sense?

I'm wondering what's the typical maintenance for bushes?  I'm sorry I don't know the names of the plants are, I'm attaching two pictures - one of last summer and one showing how the plants look right now all brambly.

g8f87q,gardening,What are some hardy houseplants for indoors and tiny pots?,"Hello! I want to fill my life with more green, and I‚Äôm looking for recommendations of plants that would be suitable for me.

So here‚Äôs the deal. 

I go away sometimes for work, sometimes for 2-4 weeks, so I need plants that can survive that occasional long period without water. 

I live in a small room so I‚Äôm looking for plants that could survive in a tiny pot (like the size of a teacup) for at least a few years. 

The plant also needs to survive in shade. I don‚Äôt have a windowsill, and so the plants will be 1-5 meters from the window. 

Also how important is it that pots have drainage holes? If I put some gravel at the bottom, and use potting soil that i could mix with sand, would that be alright?

Also wondering if any of the plants my mum has ([Here‚Äôs ](https://imgur.com/a/97XBiCl) the gallery) suit my requirements. She‚Äôs gifted me the (what I think is a) jade plant, but I could also take some of her many many succulents. I don‚Äôt want to take them if they‚Äôre going to die though.

g9fkug,gardening,Bad Flowerbed Cleanup Service?," Hey guys,

I hired a landscaping company to come out and perform a flowerbed cleanup at my house. The flowerbed wasn't maintained for over a year and had a lot of St. Augustine grass plus other weeds growing all over it so it was a pretty big project for them. The flowerbed I would say is a normal size for your average single story family home. I live in Houston, TX.

Anyways, they dug up all the dirt to remove all the grass roots, applied new soil around the existing plants, applied weed killer, and then put black mulch on top and were on their way.

About 5 days later, I see new grass sprouts shoot up all over in the flowerbed. I don't know if this is normal and I should just be plucking them out or did the landscaping service not properly dig out the grass root system when they were here? I would think with all the digging, creating a new edge, weed killer, and mulch that I wouldn't see grass popping up for quite some time. I understand that grass and other weeds would appear eventually, but this just seems way too soon. Less then a week after service? I paid a lot of money and this is not what I expected.

Did the landscapers not do a proper and job and should I complain/make them redo it or is this normal flowerbed issues? I don't know as this is my first time being a homeowner and having a flowerbed.

What are your thoughts and what would you do?

Thanks!",5,/r/gardening/comments/g9fkug/bad_flowerbed_cleanup_service/

In the last few years we have already spread seeds, scarified the garden and scattered seeds and unfortunately always with the same result: we have no green lawn.

We suspect that the reason is that the lawn gets too little sunlight (the shadow cast should be clearly visible in the picture).

Hence my question to the experts:
How do we manage to get a sustainable green lawn in our garden?

Many greetings and many thanks!",5,/r/gardening/comments/g9j50y/help_how_do_i_get_a_green_lawn_with_little/

g9wzxv,gardening,Which is the true Rapunzel plant?,"In the  German Fairytale, Rapunzel is locked up in a tower for stealing an  edible plant. I am trying to find out which plant this actually was, and  have uncovered a lot of confusion/mystery. There is clearly an  etymological connection between Rapunzel and the name ""Rampion"", but  ""Rampion"" is itself a confusing name, since it refers (in English) to  both a type of Bellflower (*Campanula rapunculus*, ""Rampion Bellflower"" or just ""Rampion"") and a closely related genus (*Phyteuma*). It was *C. rapunculus* that I first became aware of a claim to being Rapunzel's plant (see wikipedia: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campanula\_rapunculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campanula_rapunculus)).  Many other sources agree. But then I came across several other sources  claiming the plant from the fairytale was in fact Spiked Rampion (*Phyteuma spicatum*). (eg [https://metro.co.uk/2011/06/29/rapunzel-fairytale-flower-on-brink-of-extinction-61493/](https://metro.co.uk/2011/06/29/rapunzel-fairytale-flower-on-brink-of-extinction-61493/), [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyteuma\_spicatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyteuma_spicatum)). Both are edible, and related, but have totally different flowers and the story cannot have referred to both of them.

So I went to the wikipedia page for the Rapunzel fairytale to see if I it could resolve the matter ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapunzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapunzel)). It tells me the following:

&gt;A lonely couple, who long for a child, live next to a walled garden belonging to a sorceress.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapunzel#cite_note-5) The wife, experiencing the cravings associated with pregnancy, notices some [rapunzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerianella_locusta) (a salad green) growing in the nearby garden and longs for it.

Where does that link go? Why to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerianella\_locusta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerianella_locusta), of course. (/s)  Lamb's Lettuce / Cornsalad?? Which grows as a weed in my garden??

g9x664,gardening,How do you know what are local wildflowers?,"Hello, I live in a small house in Buffalo Grove, Illinois (USA) and have a small patch of soil next to my front door that I want to use to plant local wildflowers.

So I'm thinking instead of having some unfriendly gravel to give some good use to that small piece of soil and put there some local wildflowers or plants.

But when came fall (I live in 5B Canada) I got sick and couldn't take care of it. 
Everything died, and all the dead plants spent the winter in their pots.

From strawberry, to raspberries, to carrots. Tomatoes too. Pepper. 

I know the plants that only last a year has to be pulled and thrown away, but what do I do with the strawberry plants? It's just a bunch of dead leaves now. 

And, what do I need to put in the soil, to give it the nutrients needed to grow plants another season? I used potting soil for all my plants.

My question is, if I want more tomatoes throughout the summer- do I just start more seeds in a week or so? Do I have to prep a whole other container for the next plant? Once the original tomatoes are harvested, what happens to the plant? I'm sorry if these answers are somewhere on this sub but everything is starting to blur together in my head.

Edit: looking at the notes I've taken today, I figured I would shoot some other questions out here if you kind people wouldn't mind answering some of them. I live in zone 6b. Can I harvest spinach/arugula all summer if I keep them in a shaded location, even though they generally like cooler weather? Can I grow mint in an 8"" pot or will that mess it up?

* Is it too early in the year to start dealing with the grass? It is looking very bumpy.
* I think the previous owner had some sprinklers that were not taken care of, should I pull those out?
* Should I try to level everything off?
* The goal is to have a small patio (outdoor tiles) for the grill and seating, then just some areas of flowers, etc like a nice English garden.

fub3pc,gardening,I need help managing my Kousa Dogwood tree,"I bought my house in 2017 and it had a nice Kousa Dogwood in the front yard that must have been treated in some way to prevent fruiting that I don't know and it's driving me batty.  It had no fruit when I toured, no fruit when I inspected, no fruit when I moved in.  

It must've been dealt with by the prior owner before handing me the keys but since then it's produced a ton of fruit every year since then and I simply don't have the time or energy to deal with the constant dropping of dogwood fruit.  By the time it falls it's so fragile it just smears when I try to rake it up and it starts to stink real quick.  

I could try to get ahead of it and somehow pick them all off the tree when they appear but that's also a lot of effort and I'd like to avoid getting on a ladder surrounded by a whole mess of bright red semi-sweet stinging insect magnets.  Plus I know there has to be some way to get the tree to not fruit since the prior owner figured it out.

Last year I tried Florel brand Ethephon.  I applied twice.  Once with a handheld pump sprayer in fairly early spring when I just started noticing leaves and then again later with a hose attachment when flowers were in bloom before fruit appeared.  3oz/gallon both times, as best I could manage.

I may have over done it since I did get some burnt-looking edges on a few leaves but we also had a heat wave.  If it did anything at all, it may have delayed the fruits somewhat from the previous year but they still came and came with force.  Though I think they didn't fall as readily and some died on the tree and I think are still there, actually.

I couldn't find proper instructions for dealing with Kousa Dogwood and the Florel insert mentioned two different times to spray depending on the type of tree so I just did both.  But that was obviously wrong.  So when should I be spraying for fruit-prevention to be effective?  Should I spray a stronger solution, or is there a different chemical that might be more effective?

Is this the sort of thing I would be better off trying to contract out to a landscaper or arborist, and if so would any landscaper be qualified or do I need to find one with some sort of specialty?  Really appreciate any help or advice, thanks.

I like the tree, but did not realize how much fruit it would drop on the lawn until I had owned it for a year.  Is there any subreddit that this might be more suited to?",4,/r/gardening/comments/fub3pc/i_need_help_managing_my_kousa_dogwood_tree/

fuh8ap,gardening,Dahlia Tubers,"Hello Everybody !  
This is a Dahlia tuber, that I got this year. This was one of the best-looking ones, but I am still not sure that it will be alive. I bought one of the same variety from the same shop couple of years ago for a friend, and it was very beautiful. So I bought one last year for myself and it didn't grow, so now I am trying again. Do you think I can save it ? Any tips ?  
P.s. I put it a bit in water, in hope that it will re-hydrate itself (i know that too much water will eventually damage it)

fuhbsj,gardening,Help! Bugs flying out of my potting soil bag,"Hi! So I am prepping a soil mix for some seeds and I bought vermiculite, perlite, &amp; potting soil (Whitney Farms Organic Potting Soil, I didn‚Äôt buy it due to any type of preference it was just the only potting soil that I could get delivered to me in a reasonable time at an affordable price during this current world situation). 

All of the bags were brand new, unopened and I don‚Äôt have any other plants or pre-existing bug issues (I live really, really high up in an apartment). When I opened the potting soil, the first thing that I noticed was that the soil was damp/slightly warm (this makes no sense because I got it yesterday and it has been kept in a dark area of my apartment). About 3 minutes after I opened the potting soil I noticed the first bug &amp; I thought *maybe* it had gotten in because I just had my balcony door open, but then I saw another bug a few seconds later flying near the bag, and finally I saw a bug fly out of the bag.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do and I didn‚Äôt want more bugs getting out (also didn‚Äôt want the bugs to stay in there &amp; keep laying eggs), so I just... put it on my balcony. I‚Äôve checked on it twice &amp; have seen more bugs fly out. I have no clue how they were surviving in there because there were no holes in the bag. 

Based on all the research I did before ordering supplies for my garden &amp; the 2 semesters I spent doing fieldwork to analyze arthropod diversity, I‚Äôm pretty sure that these are fungus gnats. 

I really don‚Äôt know what to do because I know there‚Äôs no point in starting seedlings with that soil because it could mess up my seeds &amp; it would bring bugs into my apartment. It took me THREE WEEKS of planning and ordering to get everything here &amp; ready to start gardening. I‚Äôve been so excited to do this because I‚Äôve been stuck inside for a month now (self-isolating because I‚Äôm high risk), &amp; I‚Äôm super bummed. 

Is there any way I can save the soil &amp; get rid of the bugs? Or, alternatively, can vermiculite be used as a seed starter?",4,/r/gardening/comments/fuhbsj/help_bugs_flying_out_of_my_potting_soil_bag/

fuin8s,gardening,Cultivating wild city purslane?,"So I have heard that purslane is edible.  It grows wild around here sometimes, like it does in a lot of places.  I'd like to grow some, and I'd love for it to be something that's already hardy in this climate, so I want to forage up some growing wild and start growing it in my garden.

But is it safe to just take some growing wild and put it in a container?  Will it have diseases it could give to other plants?  Will it be safe to eat?  If it's had pesticides or dog poop or animal scat on it, will new growth from a cutting be safe to eat, or will there be diseases/toxins inside?

fuko7f,gardening,Planting in straight dirt?,"New gardener! I just spent a the day starting my garden and I wanted to go over what I did with some more experienced members. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt research a ton before doing everything. 

I recently moved into this house and the backyard is almost entirely dirt. There‚Äôs hardly any grass or plants at all. I put edging down, dug in the dirt and created a ‚Äúcompost trench‚Äù using primarily somewhat already broken down,  composted bunny waste. This is about a 8-12 inches down. Then, I filled the dirt back up, and topped the dirt with just a thin layer of gardening soil to keep the top from drying out. I‚Äôm planning on using a liquid fertilizer since the compost trench probably won‚Äôt be helping for a while.

The soil is pretty sandy. Plants Im gardening are pretty basic- mostly lettuces, herbs, greens. Should I do anything else to the soil?

I have this nice Japanese maple but the leaves are prematurely failing. There is clearly some kind of problem with these. 

The leaves are blotchy, not a solid medium green but instead blotched with lighter green/yellow. The discoloration starts to happen from the middle of the leaf and gets progressively worse as it goes to the edges. The tips of the leaves turn red, curl inward, with some tips brown and dry, and some of them brown and wilt away while still small leaves (please see the attached photos to see exactly what I'm talking about).

I showed this to people at my local Armstrong garden and they say it's due to the cold weather we are having here in Los Angeles, good amount of rain lately and medium low temps. They say the temperature fluctuations and cold are what are causing it. I want to add that I haven't used any fertilizer or ammendments to the soil since I have planted it.

It is planted in the ground, the soil is a sandy loam with good drainage, covered with a layer of mulch. The tree faces the east and gets morning sun only. I haven't watered the tree yet this year due to the rain we have experienced, constantly keeping it well watered and moist, especially with the landscape fabric and mulch layer over the roots; the soil should be well flushed out from all salt and chemical buildups too. I don't think it's an insect problem.

I'm not sure if this is a mineral deficiency that I need to correct with soil amendments or fertilizers or if it really is a cold issue. I thought Japanese maples thrive in the cold rainy weather?

Any help is much appreciated. Thank you",4,/r/gardening/comments/fvm7h5/japanese_maple_coral_barksango_kaku_problem/

However, something is eating my sprouts at night. I‚Äôm covering my zucchini sprouts with Tupperware at night and crossing my fingers for the other small exposed sprouts. Without fail, though, a number of the uncovered plants get eaten, leaving a small leafless nub sticking out of the ground. 

I‚Äôve seen evidence of something small (field mouse?) having dug under a Tupperware or two to eat the zucchini sprouts, leaving a small mound of disturbed soil behind its entrance point. 

I have some live traps with peanut butter, a rolling log trap with peanut butter, and snail and slug pellets dropped all around the plants, but the traps have not been successful.  

Any advice? I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a mouse and/or slugs/snails, but I really don‚Äôt want to have to tuck my plants into Tupperware every night...

I was clearing an overgrown area out when I discovered that there was a large amount of wild blackberries growing near the edge of our cleared property. Basically my family lives on 3 acres, 2 of which are just woods that we don‚Äôt really use and the other 1 had most of its trees cleared out decades ago (the berries are growing right on the border of the two zones. The main problem right now is that every time it rains, all of the water drains into the wooded area and the population of mosquitoes explodes. I sprayed myself with OFF! And they still swarmed me. Since I need to work to clear up the area the berries are growing of overgrown brush to help them grow and farm them, I need to find a way to control, if not eliminate, the mosquitoes. Does anyone have any ideas that could help fix the problem? Feel free to ask for more information if needed.

(Extra information)
The wooded area is pretty much a mature forest since only trees grow there (not much grass or other plants). 
The wooded area is largely shaded so any water that builds up in that area won‚Äôt evaporate quickly, if at all. 
Cutting down the trees isn‚Äôt an option.
Since the blackberry patch is already established and maturing, I can‚Äôt replant them somewhere else or it could harm them.

After this I planted a new batch and low and behold, about half are gone overnight yet again.

fxc6n4,gardening,My Habanero plant is acting strange.,"I planted it 3 days ago. watered when I planted at night and in the morning it looked great! but as the day progressed the leaves wilt a lot. It is to my understanding that they need to be watered 2 times a week, they do not need much water. Ive been checking the soil and its been moist, but a little to moist for my liking. Im assuming that was because I didn't prop up the the container by putting something under to get the best drainage and i fixed that today (Ive also made sure my container has 4 draining holes on the bottom). but its still wilting during the day. I live in southwest florida, the soil I am using is potting mix miracle grow because it is in a container. The only thing that has made it look great is when I put a very large plastic pitcher over it to increase the humidity and it looks better than ever! but when I take it off it wilts again in no time. It cant be in the dome forever? it needs air and sunlight but the little plant gets weird in the florida heat. How can I stabilize it so i can just water when i need to and put in the sun without wilting? is the humidity making it look good because during the day the leaves loose moisture?

I have a 3x3x3 black compost bin that is about 3/4 full. I cut the grass two days ago and put a decent sized pile of clippings next to the bin to turn a couple days, dry out, and add into the bin over time.

Yesterday, I was turning the pile of freshly cut grass clippings. First turn, already steaming! Second turn... third turn, two bunnies came tumbling out of the center!!

I was startled and jumped back. Mind started racing, did I disturb a nest? But, I just dropped these clippings here the day before! First instinct was get the two dogs inside the house. Next, do I cover them back up and let them hang out in the compost? They were about the size of chipmunks, eyes open, fully furred and able to hop.

I'm reading online that they are probably on their own at this point. Out of the nest and weaned off their mother. Did they find the pile of grass clippings and make a new home? Is it safe to remove them (I'm mainly worried about my dogs; they are already interested in what's making the grass clippings pile move...).

Last night, I put some bamboo stakes around the pile just to try and deter outsiders from getting in. At least until I figure out what to do with them.

I have a vegetable garden started, and I really don't want these two bunnies growing up in my compost thinking my garden is a free lunch. But, I also don't want to feed them to the vultures by forcing them out of my yard. They came here for a reason, that steaming pile of composting grass clippings looked enticing!

I've never had this happen before... Anyone have advice on what I should do next?

Ideally just leave them alone. But again, the dogs are an issue, the garden is an issue, and I need to turn the compost!! :)

My issue is that my last frost date for my area (Worcester County, MA) isn't till April 28th. My ground is soft and can be worked easily. Can we plant these trees this weekend when they are delivered?

So far the weather says the only day it will below freezing is Saturday - low of 31 F overnight. - Will it be safe to plant that day or should I wait till Sunday? After Sunday the lowest temp looks like is 35 overnight.

fxu5gt,gardening,Basil not flowering.,"Hey, Sorry if this its a silly thing to post about, so my bad in advance if this post doesn't belong..

But I have had this weird problem with my Basil.  I had a good year with it  - planted like 100 plants and had 80 of them survive the pack of deer that hangs out on my lawn at midnight.  The problem is that they won't flower. I wanted to collect some seeds from the remaining plants I have left, but I am worried they are going to die before I can.  Is there something I am missing that I need to do to make the enter that blooming stage? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know at the end of the day I could just purchase some seeds - but I kind of wanted to see if I could get a second generation out of what I had just for the fun of it. Thanks in advance for the help!",4,/r/gardening/comments/fxu5gt/basil_not_flowering/

fy2vm5,gardening,Baby earwig infestation in my planter box. How do I get rid of them?,"I live in Denver, CO. I've had an earwig problem at my house for a couple of years now. Last year it got pretty bad, they ate almost all of my produce and flowers. So this year, before the growing season started up again, I decided to clear out almost everything in my backyard that could be accumulating moisture. There were some bags of mulch sitting around so I emptied and moved those, and some debris, but not much. I'm kind of surprised it got so bad because my backyard is really dry otherwise. Denver is also very dry by nature.

ANYWAY, so I have this 4x10 planter box filled with soil. While I didn't cover it over the winter months, I did pull out the dead plants at the beginning of fall last year. I go out there today to pull out a few weeds and just check out the soil in general (I wanted to plant some spring seeds soon). 

After turning the soil a little bit, I realize there are a MILLION little baby white earwigs living in the soil. I almost had a heart attack. I am kind of freaking out because this makes me think that they are probably everywhere in my backyard, not just in my planter box, and I don't know if I can even grow plants in there.

I looked through this thread to see if anyone had dealt with a similar issue but don't see a ton. This seems very bad and past the point of using things like traps or something. However, I don't want to get an exterminator and ruin the soil or endanger beneficial insects with pesticides. 

Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? I have no idea what to do.

Thanks,

I planted these bulbs with the 'help' of my cat who has since passed away and it's one of the last memories I have of spending time with him. 
When I moved home I took the bulbs with me and haven't really paid attention to them since because its been hard to deal with the idea, however I've just noticed they have started to grow whilst in the cardboard box.

fz9ucx,gardening,University project - http://icrow.us/ an AI powered animal pest deterrent,"Hello everyone!

For  our final project, my team is building a device that scares away animal pests like squirrels, rats, deer etc. with targeted sounds and lights.  Our prototype device has a camera, and we use motion detection and image  recognition to detect the pests and play various sounds to scare them  away (also flash lights at night time). We also provide the data around  the detected animals in a dashboard like here: [http://icrow.us/garden\_report/](http://icrow.us/garden_report/)

We  found that most deterrents we put in gardens are not targeted. Either  they are static like a fence, or they continuously create sounds or  lights, allowing the animals to get resistant to them. We thought using  targeted sounds would be more effective to deter pests without actually  hurting them. Kind of like keeping a pet for your garden, alert and only  making a noise when necessary.

What  do you think of this idea? Could you also please take a survey to tell  us about your experience with pests, and what you think of this idea and  product?

Three years ago I decided to start trying my hand at gardening in containers and this photo is my 2019 start to mid season efforts.  In the end we had around 50+ tomato plants, about half that in pepper plants, and several dozen more types of veggies in small quantities.

Learned a few tricks over the last few years to reduce cost and stretch supplies in this kind of setup.  one of my favorite cost savers was switching from expensive ready made wire frames that the store sells to making them myself out of concrete wire.

Hope everyone is being safe and enjoying their gardening during this lockdown.

&amp;#x200B;

I am having trouble trying to start seedlings and was hoping you all could help diagnose my issue. I was pretty excited to see the seedling sprouting, however, within a week of sprouting, the same thing keeps happening to all of the plants. They look as though they are shriveling up and dying :(

[https://imgur.com/a/zodKmSO](https://imgur.com/a/zodKmSO)

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure if I am giving too much water? Too much light? Not enough water?

&amp;#x200B;

I initially though it was too much light because I had the grow lights on for like 16 hours out of the day but I am wondering now if it is too much water because I am seeing some white mold on the outside of the cardboard seed starter boxed.

Please let me know what I am doing wrong!!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,

Jnapp18

g1y758,gardening,To what extent can I combine SIP and hugelkultur in my raised beds?,"Hi all!

I've done in-ground gardening for a few years and I'm building out about 90 sq ft (8.5 m^2 ) of raised beds this year.

I really like the idea of sub-irrigation watering (similar to [this](https://youtu.be/Lp9Jdyno9hI) ), but I was also hoping to use a fair amount of organic matter to build up the lower part of my bed, similar to a hugelkultur mound. 

Does anyone have tips on how to do this successfully? Wicking water up into the soil seems like it would be an issue. I was thinking of backfilling around the sticks and leaves with a potting mix with a high perlite load to increase wicking. Maybe even bury some fabric strips vertically.

Thoughts? I like both gardening techniques, but they seem tricky to combine correctly.",4,/r/gardening/comments/g1y758/to_what_extent_can_i_combine_sip_and_hugelkultur/

I know that some plants grow tall, so planting a tall plant in a 5 foot tall be would be an issue.

I'm assuming issues would include that's a lot of space you'd need to fill and if you built it out of wood the pressure would be a lot on the sides.  Couldn't you build a tall brick bed instead?

Also, my grandma has a farm and I've seen far fewer earthworms on the concrete walkways around her farm/garden than I have on campus, which seems very counter-intuitive to me.

Hope everyone is hanging in there.üíñ
During this quarantine I decided to revamp the overgrown gardens in my backyard. I also started container gardening. I am growing spinach and yellow squash in containers and I‚Äôm planning on growing mammoth sunflowers against my fence as a privacy screen and I‚Äôm going to do a wildflower garden in a tiny garden bed. 

I have my spinach planted and I‚Äôm not too worried about it because it‚Äôs a pretty hearty vegetable. But I haven‚Äôt done my yellow squash yet because we woke up with a frost this morning. I‚Äôm also hesitant to plant the sunflowers and the wildflowers if we are still having frosts.

I‚Äôve seen people talk about what zone they are in and I don‚Äôt know how to figure out that information. I live about an hour from Philadelphia. Bucks county. I guess I‚Äôm just trying to figure out when the last frost would be around here. 

As far as planting my sunflowers, i‚Äôve seen people say that you should plant them in a trench. Any tips for sunflowers?

The problem is she started it by just shoving seeds and sprouts in the ground, and calling it good. No soil prep, no weeding, not even checking if we had the tools. She tried to plant bulbs in about 1 inch of soil above a cotton wood tree root about a foot thick.  I'm pretty sure almost all the seeds have been dug up and eaten too by birds. The only thing I have confidence in is a grape vine that somehow grows in soil that I can hardly get a spade through.

This garden feels hopeless before it starts. I got some new digging tools today, including an axe to get rid of that root, and she got a bunch of potting soil. We also do have a compost pile with some good soil in it. Anything else I can do to salvage this or does it sound like I'm on the right track?

g3lnsf,gardening,Trying To Get MAX Growth Indoors- Anything I Could Be Doing Differently/Better?," 

Hi,

I'm looking for ways to improve my setup below, I'm trying to get as possible to perfect conditions, and these Cayenne Chilli plants took only 8 weeks to get this size from seed!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oib648c54kt41.jpg?width=3455&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ded53a4e33d5f29bdeb4f56db8dbe309c830c111

 

The setup is lit with 24/7 LED light and reflective backing. Watering is an automatic system from the reservoir on the left, which is dosed with Chilli Right feed and a tiny amount of bleach/chlorine to keep the lines clear of algae (the previous clear lines got blocked, hence the move to black). For ventilation, the fan comes on over a certain temperature, and if things still get super hot, an alarm sounds for me to open the window.

Any feedback or improvements would be great if possible, thanks!

g47295,gardening,"Preparing for cabbage worms, BT questions","Every year, caterpillars destroy all my brassicas by midsummer. I have to treat them as a spring-only crop, and have totally given up on some of my fave veggies like broccoli and brussels sprouts that are planted in the spring and harvested in fall. Watching my little kale seedlings get bigger and bigger, I'd like to try harder to protect them this year. 

I know BT is an effective pesticide for the caterpillars, but it's such a royal pain to prepare and apply. I tried it using a 32oz handheld spray bottle. I had to do the math with the oz and measure as a fraction of a teaspoon, since that was way less than the gallon of water the instructions suggested. And even then, I only ever emptied half that small bottle. Having to do this every week (and more when it rains!) was just not something I could make myself keep up with. I can't even make myself apply fertilizer more than a couple of times a year. I applied the BT maybe 3 times, and then found myself putting it off until my plants were destroyed. My fault for being lazy, I know. 

Is there any way to prepare BT where I don't have to mix it fresh every time? Is there some form of it that would be easier to prepare for a 16oz or 32oz spray bottle? And, I've had the first bottle I bought for maybe 5 years, does it go bad or lose potency?",4,/r/gardening/comments/g47295/preparing_for_cabbage_worms_bt_questions/

Just about all of my seedlings have wilted, the stalks have turned whiteish, and the leaves are soft and droopy. 

Any ideas on what I‚Äôm doing wrong? This is first real go at vegetables, so I‚Äôm flying blind.

Hopefully you don't make the same mistakes I did! Here's a few...,"1. Figure out how to manage your watering. I had lots of damage due to big swings in over wet and over dry plants. Peppers hated it and had poor production and tomatoes got some disease from it. I didn't use mulch it anything to cover the dirt so and watered to much.
2. Space your plants out. I used the square foot gardening method and it had me placing the plants way too close together. Poor air flow caused issues and if one plant got a bug/disease they all got the same thing immediately.
3. Succession plant. I planted every inch of the garden on day one and ended up with more vegetables than me and my relatives could eat for about a two week period (per plant type) and then not enough even for my family after that. This was worst for lettuce. 
4. Don't be afraid to trim/prune/train plants back. It was hard to trim plants because it felt like I was reduce their production. Instead they got overgrown and to crowded which let diseases and bugs go crazy. 
5. Be preventative with bugs and diseases. I'm still working out the best way to do this but waiting to see a problem meant it was too late. I'm sure I just need to get better at identifying them earlier but I don't have that experience yet so I need to be more preventative.",4,/r/gardening/comments/g4ujug/lessons_learned_ive_only_been_a_gardening_a/

These two plants have me a little confused.  First, our school is in Los Gatos, CA which puts us in zone 9b.  The school garden faces E/NE but what we've been growing has done well (except for that pesky cauliflower heh).

The snow peas have gotten huge.  They are beautiful and healthy and flowering.  From the info I can find they are an annual plant though.  Do they need to be pulled out and new seeds planted?  The question is similar for the linaria.  The linaria is not as beautiful as it was but it is still producing new stalks that flower.  Should I plant new seeds or let it keep going?  The linaria seedlings was a gift and in the madness of the school year I just plated them in a pot without reading much about them :(.

After reading some advice online, I decided to cut the broken vines back to the next healthy leaf junction. Was this the right thing to do? Or would it have continued to grow with the vine bent and damaged? The plant was already starting to bud when I purchased it, and I am disappointed that the broken vines had some lovely buds on them.

g5ftt0,gardening,[UK] What's wrong with my bay's leaves:(,"Hey,

I've been growing a bay plant in a pot for around two years, and at some point a while ago, some leaves got black spots, to varying degrees, sometimes yellowing the leaves. I cut a couple of the worst ones off, but even on new growth the black spots are still appearing, although less at the moment.

No leaves are curling or looking like what bay suckers do, and I can't see any bugs on it when I glance over it, so I'm not sure what's going on with it :s

It's flowering for the first time since I've had it, and it still seems to be growing fast, so I think it's still healthy at the moment, but these look like some disease or pest I can't see, and would like to be rid of.

Can anyone identify, and what should I do here?

During spring/summer I put my yucca outside next to it, and it also sits next to a rosemary. Both of those are doing very well and show no signs of any transferred bugs either. If it helps, I live in Nottingham in the East Midlands, with moderately hard water.

g5grux,gardening,New to Gardening. Have some questions.,"I have a small garden in my backyard and last spring/summer i started to grow some tomatoes and different herbs. This year due to the quarantine i have more time to prep and maybe make some cool things to allow me to grow different veg/plants in a small area. 

I heard building a make shift green house is a cheap way of maximizing growth. Based on a quick google search it seems like i have access to the materials needed to build one, but is it a smart idea? Its easy enough to put together but if it has no major benefit i wont bother. I live in Toronto, if that matters at all to if a greenhouse is good based on the climate?

Are there any designs or things i can build almost like a tiered shelving system to maximize my space? or do i need to allow the plants to have as much space as possible. I have material, time and a little more than basic knowledge on how to use tools, so if there are good designs to try out i can manage.

Any other general information and tips are appreciated. Any recommendations on plants that are easy to get going or simple enough to care for as a beginner.

After a bit, I was told my by the family member to put them in a pot outside and he sent pictures of the pots he uses.   


I went to Home Depot and asked them what I should use, and they told me to use these little 1ft planters, and they looked like what my family member uses. Today I was reading that tomatoes need around 18 inches of soil, and mine have maybe 7-8 inches. The whole pot is 12 inches deep. They are mainly looking good, but I am worried they won't continue growing. What is the best way to keep them healthy? Can I safely transplant them at this point to a bigger pot?  


Also, one of the three plants is getting a white ""burn"" on the original leaves. The newer leaves look healthy, but should I be worried about this, and is there anything I can do to fix it?  


Thanks!

When I re-potted it a few days ago there were a small number of brown mushy roots which I removed (I'm a total beginner and I didn't really think much of it). Now I've been reading more about plant care I have re-dug up the roots to have look (those are the photos in the image). Is this plant still rotting? I can especially notice a brown bit at the bottom of the root stem. Is it salvageable (i.e. water it much less) or should I just take another cutting and start again? Can this plant infect other ones?

Other info: I'm growing indoors the UK; the plant is getting lots of sunlight, supplemented by light from an LED grow light. The Basil cutting is from one of those those cheap overcrowded supermarket plants.

I am now an owner of pre-grown plants of various sorts:

- 4ft money tree

- a blooming calla lily

- various orchids

- various succulents

- azalea bonsai

As well as four different baby bonsai trees I've grown from seeds. I've also ordered a meyer lemon tree for the patio. Zone 8a.

They're all healthy, for now I guess, but I have no idea what I'm doing. I Google each plant individually, and see things like, ""slightly acidic soil"" and ""feed your plant fertilizer"", and I don't know where to start with this.

My plan was to continue googling until I get more concrete information, but I still don't have any confidence that I understand why I will do the things I will do.

When do I know when to repot things? How do I actually pick the right soil, or are they all ""acidic"", ""slightly acidic"", ""not acidic""? What exactly is the right fertilizer? Where does peat moss and pebbles come in exactly, and why? What exactly does ""water once a week"" mean, do I just do it outside and let it soak through? Sometimes water from the bottom? What about those pebbles? Do I mist the plants in between, or just some of them, or just when watering? Why does one website say to water plant X once a week, and another say once or twice a month, and how do I figure out where I stand? What is ""plant food"" and how do I know I'm doing it enough or too much, and what does it really do?

g85fw2,gardening,First time gardener - have i used the wrong mulch and how bad is this?,"Greetings gardeners! My wife and I are trying gardening for the first time this year.

I think I have put the wrong type of mulch around our tomatoes and peppers. We are growing four tomato plants and three peppers plants in containers. I put about an inch layer of [Vigoro bagged brown mulch](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Vigoro-2-cu-ft-Bagged-Brown-Mulch-52050196/205606287) on top around the base of the plant. After re-watching some of the youtube videos and reading some of the comments about this mulch I realized it may not be what we needed for our vegetables. Most of the youtubers I watched recommended hardwood mulch and I was so focused on the other steps that I didn't pay enough attention to what mulch is being used.

How big of a oops is this? Should I change it out? I only transplanted the tomatoes today and the peppers have been in about 4 days. Have I caused damage to my plants? Will they be safe for eating? Will they taste different due to possible chemicals in this mulch? We have put quite a bit of effort and we want tasty tomatoes and peppers!

g8es8z,gardening,What's the best solution to level out this area and prepare it?,"As you can see in the images here:

https://imgur.com/a/8YxVfkF

I've started work on the back of the garden. It slopes from top to bottom and also has a nice gradient from left to right, all the way across. We previously had a 15ft trampoline up there to the left of the shed and as you can see that's now gone.

We're replacing our shed and wanting to put it over to the left hand side. We also want to have a some deck over to the right hand side, as that's the sun trap, and maybe an open area between the two.

You can see, via the concrete wall, that it's about 10 inches higher at the back than the front. As you can see, I've started turning the soil and dragging it down as my first though was to level it out, kind of like a see saw. I was going to do just the left corner for the shed but I reckon the whole area should probably be done and it measures 29ft across by about 12-13ft deep, so an area of about 360 square foot.

The top soil isn't too bad but being london, we've clay quite quickly underneath. We've also got some monster brambles. One in particular has about 8 legs and goes at least a foot deep (not got to the bottom of it yet!). There's loads, about 20-30 of the buggers.

Would a rotorvator be the best solution for the whole area?

I'm at a bit of a loss about what to do with it and hope I can find some solutions from you kind knowledgable people.

I was thinking of, at the back near the fence, about a foot in, to dig down and put some boarding all the way across to hold it back and maybe do some at the front  as well, so that the whole area can be levelled from front to back and left to right.

To stop the brambles and weeds, I was thinking of covering the whole area with tarpaulin .

As you can probably tell, I'm not an expert and to be honest, not really sure what I'm doing.

Any help or opinions are greatly appreciated.

What is this ‚Äúscab‚Äù-looking stuff? 

Are the pieces with that sort of discoloration worth keeping around? Will they grow any more?

Should it cut off the little bit of new growth on top of the heavily scabbed piece? Is it too small to re-pot/propagate?

Can I re-pot that clean piece that has a small piece of new growth? Would the small new growth survive that? I want to re-pot because it‚Äôs been in this pot for 2-3 years.

So I am making this post on 4/26.  On 4/17, we got about 6 inches of snow in a Spring snow storm.  I went out and shook off everything to try preventing everything from getting weighed down or the snow causing any more harm than it already was.  The snow was gone within in a day.  

Today, we were out doing a lot of clipping and I noticed some of the lilacs beginning to bloom.  Then I looked down the stalk and saw it looked fairly similar to a white powdery mildew disease that took out a leafy bush we had in the backyard about 3 ft away.  I took that bush out a few years ago.  

I'm just trying to figure out what is wrong with the lilacs and why do some branches that just don't look right compared to other healthy ones in the yard still have leaves?  I already did some pruning on the mildew looking ones...that's the first picture.  Second picture relates to the first paragraph and third is brown spots that, while on a leafing end, did not look right.

g8qzl2,gardening,Question - Lemon Tree,"Hi Gardeners!

My lemon tree produces great crops of lemons, but it is looking a bit sick - the leaves are pale and yellow.

It's about 4 years old.  The lime tree next to it is about 3 years old, and as you can see, has beautiful dark leaves.

[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/WCwa0sn)

I have tried the commonly recommended remedies - epsom salts, citrus fertilizer.

I did leave some lemons on the tree for pretty much a whole year - would this be a problem?  I removed all the last-year ones now.

I cannot see any type of pests/mould/fungi etc on the plant.

I am located in Christchurch, New Zealand.  We are a temperate maritime climate, only *just* gets frosty in winter, highest temperatures in summer of about 28 degrees celsius.  I put a frost cloth over it to protect it in the winter. 

It's just coming into autumn (fall) now, and I first noticed the pale leaves a few months ago.

I would love to hear your ideas as to what may be the problem, and how to fix it!

Thanks!  :-)",4,/r/gardening/comments/g8qzl2/question_lemon_tree/

g91vb6,gardening,Question - Late Start for Tomatoes / Peppers in 7b,"XPOSTED to r/vegetablegardening 

First off, thanks in advance for any answers to this specific question and for the general help overall I've gotten from this sub.

My situation : This is my first year starting everything from seed and the vast majority of what I have gotten I've already direct sowed into my beds. I have several tomato and pepper varieties in seed form and am not sure how to proceed. I'm in NW Georgia (7b) and temperatures are ranging from the 50s at night to the high 70's - low 80's during the days. I'm not sure if I should be direct sowing these or attempting to start them indoors and transplant them in a few weeks? I've done endless searches online and can't find any real direction other than that it's nearly impossible to direct sow tomatoes and peppers. If I don't have a good indoor starting setup (no area with direct light with any real space), is it an option to start these outside in peat pellets or 3"" peat cups before transplanting? Again, I'm at a bit of a loss and any direction is very much appreciated.",4,/r/gardening/comments/g91vb6/question_late_start_for_tomatoes_peppers_in_7b/

Are there any places/websites you would recommend to get started? I am new to gardening, as I've always lived in a city, but I adore sitting in my yard and it's my dream to transform the space. The previous tenants used it as a trash dump and it took months to pull out all the weeds, garbage, and glass shards. Now I have a glorious fresh slate, yet I feel in over my head. I would prefer to order some plants that are already growing, if that's even possible. The soil is very rich (there is a huge amount of onion grass, which I should probably dig up and remove as much as possible).

g9kltj,gardening,Complete and utter beginner looking for basic advice.,"   Ill keep it short. I live in the UK and I've never gardened  (probably not even a word) a day in my life. I have a completely flagged back garden and a small triangle of grass in the front. 
   
During all this free me and my wife decided we wanted to make the front garden a little more presentable just by popping some pre grown potted plants in the weed ridden little border under the window. I however haven't got a single clue what I am doing and just wanted some general guidance if possible. I can provide more detail and/or pictures if need be. 
  
As for tools i ordered a basic kit off amazon with a hand trowel, bulb trowel, weed popper, 3 pronged cultivator and hand fork. I've got 2 bags of all purpose compost from aldi and that's it. Oh and a watering can! 
  
Any and all advice is welcomed. Thank you gardeners of reddit.",4,/r/gardening/comments/g9kltj/complete_and_utter_beginner_looking_for_basic/

I have chickens so I throw their poo on the soil every now and then for the trees.

g2h58p,gardening,Amateur growing Carolina Reaper...any help?,"My son, 12, likes extreme stuff. He knows Carolina Reaper peppers are insane. For his birthday, he asked for seeds. Being new at this, I bought seedlings, but due to the corona virus, I neglected to pull them from the mailbox right when they arrived. I got 3 seedlings, but only 1 of them seems to still be viable after a week of care.

I'm okay only having one plant, but I'm not sure of the implications. Will 1 plant grow peppers without some sort of pollination? If I get a pepper, can I just replant the seeds and grow more plants? Do I need to do something special with the seeds to make them viable, or just stick them in dirt?

In short, I'm trying to figure out if this one plant can be cared for, and used to multiply, or if I need to buy more seeds/seedlings because I was neglectful.

How much area of harvest would supply a person constant food?

ft83zv,gardening,question about preserving squash,"Hi, everyone. This is my first post here and I'm pretty new to this sub, so if I'm in the wrong place I apologize. 

In light of everything that's happening these days, I stocked up a little on fresh produce. We don't have enough room to hoard, so I have to be smart about how I use this. I was able to grab a couple of kabocha squash, butternut squash, and sweet potatoes, but have no idea how to preserve them. I know the kabocha squash go pretty quickly on the counter, they lose their weight in a week or two. 

I tried googling how to preserve them and it said cube them, boil them for fifteen minutes and freeze in a tupperware. It also said that another option would be to cube, bake for 20 minutes on each side (definitely not baking all the way though), and freeze them in tupperware. 

Something about this sounded kind of odd to me, I don't know why. I was wondering if anyone here had any advice on the subject. Thanks in advance!",3,/r/gardening/comments/ft83zv/question_about_preserving_squash/

Previously at my old house I had a container garden which we'd grow mostly tomatoes and lettuce etc, that capacity still exists as I can grow over my septic field on the south side of my house in containers.  There is also an empty/clear one acre+ plot of land (I don't own but it's not being used) on next to my house which I could ask about using. With this pandemic getting fresh food from the garden to supplement is going to be more important than ever.  I'm not an expert gardener, and I've very busy with my work from home (tech/telecom) job right now.  Going to the nursery and getting already started plants, like I've always done isn't an option so growing from seed either mail ordered or what I can gather from the tomatoes etc I have from the store is probably what I'd need to do.  It's too cold for that now, but I have a large egress window in my basement that gets plenty plenty of light and is covered with a plastic cover so warmer/temp stable.  I can probably make a cold frame with what I have in my wood shop.  Starting in the house isn't an option as I have a one year old who'd destroy it in 30 seconds where I'd have enough light to do it.

I'm trying to get a huge amount of yard work done now that I'm stuck at home (I've been sent home from university), but my parents do little to no work on our yard so it's quite the jungle, especially when everything grows leaves and flowers. I'm finding a lot of small plastic containers near our porch (we used to feed a stray cat and the bowls would get blown away by the wind) as well as other containers that have collected water, leaves, and dirt, and because they've been sitting there for so long the water has become truly disgusting. Can I just dump these things out? Is there a safety issue with doing that?

Also--today, I set down one of these containers a bit too hard and a few drops of liquid jumped out. One drop definitely landed on my lip, and I immediately went inside, wiped off my lip, and then washed my face. Did I do enough? Should I be worried about the bacteria or whatever that are in that water?

Is there anything I can do to prevent so much oxalis from coming up? I don't have crab grass, just oxalis. We never get to enjoy the lawn because we're either weed killing for a month, watering for 2 months or staring at a patchy lawn. We live in northeast USA, 4 seasons.

fuzr76,gardening,A few questions about soil/compost/prepping my raised garden beds for vegetables,"Hi!

Long time follower of this subreddit and first time poster.

My fiance and I purchased a home late last summer with three raised beds in the front of the house with good sunlight. There were a lot of flowers, some tomatoes, some herbs, some lemongrass and a TON of weeds in them when we became the new home owners. By winter time, we ripped everything out. Im a newbie to gardening so I did not mulch to prevent weeds from growing so I've spent the last few days ripping weeds out and getting them ready for transplanting once my seeds are ready (I am in Zone 7). 

I've done a ton of research on how to prep the raised beds (they're about 4ft x 4ft squares) but I'm a little overwhelmed by what I've read and have some questions. 

The soil seems good and rich but it doesn't quite reach the top of the beds in some of the beds so I bought 4 huge bags of [""Kellogg All Natural Raised Bed and Potting Mix Premium""](https://www.kellogggarden.com/products/kellogg/kellogg-garden-organics-natural-raised-bed-potting-mix/) to top off the soil that's in the beds. **Question: Do I also need to buy or source compost to mix in with this Kellogg stuff or is it nutrient enough?**

I also bought this [liquid fertilizer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Kellogg-Garden-Organics-32-oz-Organic-Fish-and-Kelp-Liquid-Fertilizer-3007/204701383) to use for the garden but also eventually for my seeds that I am starting indoors. **Question: When do I need to use this outside? Can I put some in when I put the potting mix in or do I wait until after I transplant my plants?** 

**A few other questions:**

* I have some hay, should I put some on the soil while I wait for my seeds to start and keep the beds weed free?
* Do I have to put hay around the plants once I transplant them? Or if I spend some time weeding every other day is it ok to not do this? 

I think that's all the questions I have, would also love if anyone has other advice or resources on the internet that I can read! Thanks!",3,/r/gardening/comments/fuzr76/a_few_questions_about_soilcompostprepping_my/

fvkwph,gardening,Tips on growing moss inside,"https://i.imgur.com/z7Omocw.jpg 
I have this old glass water tank behind my bed and I‚Äôm wondering what the right conditions are for the moss and how to maintain them. They are situated next to a window, but the only direct sunlight coming through it is in the first half hour of the sun being up. Should I put them in a darker spot? 

I‚Äôve also heard that you should spray them with water every day for the first month. Should I just spray them or also water the tank every so often? I‚Äôve read that when you start to grow some moss somewhere it helps to mix the spores with some watered down buttermilk. Is it the acidity they like and should I maintain this by giving this watered down buttermilk?

fvwpsl,gardening,Looking for advice regarding growing potatoes in buckets/pots,"Hey /r/gardening,

I bought a bunch of potato pots ([these things](https://www.wexthuset.com/images/products/weibulls/Potapot-Potatiskruka-2.jpg)) for growing taters this year. The pots have drainage and can hold about 10L of soil. I plan to plant around three seed potatoes in each pot. 

I have a few things I am wondering about, before I put the taters in soil:

1. Is it a good idea to plant the seed potatoes in peat with pre-added fertilizer as opposed to ""regular soil""? Am I correct in am assuming it would work better with peat, since potato plants are supposed to prefer more acidic and ""airy"" soil?

2. How deep should I plant the seed potatoes? I've gotten mixed advice from other people regarding this. One camp says they should be planted deeper in the bucket, the reasoning being that they will grow upwards along the whole length of the bucket and develop a larger root system, the result being more tubers. Other people I have asked say they should be planted closer to the surface of the soil, so the shoots have an easier way to break through to light. Wat do?

3. Finally, how often should I feed the taters with fertilizer when watering? Here I've seen mixed advice as well. Some say daily addition of fertilizer is good, while others say more like every second week.

Thank you for your advice.",3,/r/gardening/comments/fvwpsl/looking_for_advice_regarding_growing_potatoes_in/

I have dealt with these before indoors and they were extremely hard to get rid of. In the past I have tried the following:

1) used the yellow sticky tape traps (moderately effective-not sure how these would work outdoors in rain etc)

2) the soil dry out as completely as I could (minimally effective, harder to do outdoors given weather changes)

3) repotted everything, replaced all soil, covered the top of the pots with an inch of sand then rocks to get rid of their breeding grounds---was effective, but seems unfeasible outdoors.

Any advice on how to get rid of them in an outdoor setting? I try to adhere to organic/natural gardening principles so ideally non-chemical pesticide options would be best!

I built two raised garden boxes for my parents while on quarantine. I also built a small retaining wall and a guard rail since the garden sits on a slope with a height of about 5'.

We are having gravel delivered to fill the bottom 4"" of the box to provide drainage. We will also install a drip system for watering.

The place in the yard where is sits gets sunshine for most of the day, so we will grow sun-loving plants in these boxes. Also built a smaller shaded box for lettuce and other things that require less sunlight.

The boxes are both 2 ft tall X 4 feet wide x 16 feet long (.6 meters tall 1.2 meters wide 4.8 meters long) for a total of 128 ft¬≤ of growing space. 

The 4x4s are pressure treated (so they won't rot) spaced 4 feet apart. They sit 12 inches deep in the ground and are set in concrete. They also rise 12 inches above the top edges of the boxes so that netting can be strung to support more delicate plants like tomatoes

The boxes are constructed out of redwood 2 x 12 lumber, which is rated for direct contact with ground and water.

The retaining wall is 24"" tall x 20' long supported by 4x4 every 4' that are sunk 18"" deep using same concrete

fwr84p,gardening,"Box Garden over (sometimes) Soggy Yard, Options","I would like to install two 4'x8' box gardens in my back yard for vegetables.  However, my yard has drainage issues (pretty much the whole back yard).  At some point, I will be tackling that, but it won't be happening this year. The yard gets full sun, so by summer, say June, the ground dries out the day after a rain.  But in the Spring, there's enough rain to keep it soggy for days on end.

The boxes I've already built are 10"" tall.  Where I plan on putting these boxes, the far end of the 8-feet will be about 4-5"" lower than the near end, if I don't do any leveling.  I'm planning to put in a combination of peat moss and organic soil.  And since the ground is basically clay, I'm planning to use a weed barrier (which will have a vent where the two side-by-side sheets of fabric overlap, down the center).

So, I'm looking for options.  I've thought about:

1. Going ahead and seeing how bad the water will affect the garden.  To accomplish this, I will level my beds by digging and sinking the near end of my beds.  Thus putting the box further in the ground.
2. Putting a layer of sand in the bottom of the box, before putting in my soil.  To accomplish this, I will likely still sink the near end of the box.
3. Putting in base of gravel on which the boxes will rest.  This will be deeper/higher on the far side to level the box.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody suppose one of these options is better than the other?  
Any further ideas, suggestions?  
Any concerns?  For instance, would the gravel stand a chance of burning roots, under the box?",3,/r/gardening/comments/fwr84p/box_garden_over_sometimes_soggy_yard_options/

Because I can't go around to store after store until I find what I want , I picked up some small jiffy pots, 2 packs of 26, so 52 total. 

Last year, I did a 72 pod seed tray , but this year that was not in stock(The other ones was broken beyond repair). The dome also didn't survive. 

So the jiffy pots have to go in 2 seed trays instead of 1 since they are bigger. 

What do you think of this plan to deal with it : 

1)I have one seed tray sized warming mat, I am thinking to switch the two trays out every 12 hours, since I am working from home and have the ability to do so. I don't want a 2nd mat, as I will go back to a one tray set up next year

2)cover the trays with plastic wrap since I don't have a dome. This isn't ideal, but I will try using some tooth picks to keep it off the surface of the seedlings.

tldr: Can seedlings survive a short drop in temp (a few hours) below freezing? 

Hello! We are in Northern California (Sonoma County). Last week (4/1/2020) we planted seeds for the first time. I'm concerned we did this just a bit early as there was a cold night just a couple of days ago. That is, on that cold morning I measured the soil (not with a soil thermometer but with an infrared thermometer) and it read 30F. I imagine this was sustained for 2-3 hours. It may be important to note the ground wasn't visibly frosty, just very cold. 

**My question then is this:** Can seedlings survive a short drop in temp below freezing? I'd like to have an idea now as it may still be another 5 days or so until I see anything sprouting.

Once identified, what's the best way to get rid of it? I had one shoot up near the house and ended up having to use a chainsaw to cut it down. I dug up as much of the roots as I could get to, and it came back. Almost feels like a fight with Audrey II.

fxrh6x,gardening,Vegetable Gardening in a Southern Climates vs Northern Climates,"Hi all. Zone 8a here (Georgia). I‚Äôm a beginning gardener. I‚Äôm originally from Utah and have found that growing vegetables in a different climate is sort of difficult. Here‚Äôs some backstory. 

I‚Äôm growing out of large containers for now. Our home faces mostly West. Last year I grew from our back deck so the garden really only got 4-6ish hours of sun depending on the time of year. It was okay but yields were not where I wanted them so we moved them down to an area of the yard where the most sun is. This happens to be on the NW side of the house because we have several trees on and surrounding the property. This area will get 8-10 hours in the summer. I‚Äôve got my tomatoes out and they already seem to be hating our midday temps in the 70s-80s. They get droopy during this time and then perk back up in the evenings when shaded. This year I have mulched with straw to keep moisture in and soil temps down but have already noticed the same issue (not sure if it‚Äôs actually an issue).

My question. Is it possible that vegetables need less sun in southern climates vs northern climates? Or is sun strength equal no matter the location? Would my veggies be happier with more shade? In UT our veggies would sit in the sun 10+ hours with no signs of stress. Would love some recommendations from others that live in the south or have lived in the south!",3,/r/gardening/comments/fxrh6x/vegetable_gardening_in_a_southern_climates_vs/

fxyq6t,gardening,Questions about veggie gardening and fertilizer,"Hey folks! I'm semi-new to gardening. Last year I had a small raised bed and used to store-bought tomato seedlings. It went okay, but this year I'm trying to a). grow stuff from seed and b). do a better job of fertilizing in the hopes of getting better yield. 

Two questions that I'm confused about: 

1. When should I start fertilizing my seedlings? and *how* should I fertilize my seedlings? I'm growing them in a sterile seed starting mix. Do they need any particular type or strength of fertilizer when they're ready? Should I follow directions for indoor or outdoor plants (right now they're indoors, but eventually they'll go outdoors, of course). When should I start fertilizing- when they have true leaves? I've got tomatoes, tomatillos, zucchini and spinach going right now. 

2. What to do with tomato tone? I got this tomato and fruiting vegetable fertilizer after reading that it's better to fertilize fruiting plants with a high calcium/high potassium fertilizer, but I'm confused about when to use it. The directions say:

&gt; Use to enhance soil prior to planting

&gt;First application after plant is established (10-14 days)

&gt;Established Plants: Twice per month May through August

Then it also goes on to say:

&gt; Tomato beds: Apply 3 lbs. (9 cups) of Tomato-tone per 50 sq. ft. and work into the top 4 to 6 inches of soil.

&gt; Single plants: Mix 3 tablespoons of Tomato-tone into the soil when planting.

&gt;For Potted Plants: 2 cups of Tomato-tone per cubic foot of soil (1.5  tbsp. of Tomato-tone for every 1 qt. of soil).

I'm really confused- am I supposed to use it when I plant the tomatoes or not?  Or should I mix the fertilizer into the soil before planting anything and then again 10-14 days after planting?

I have a Mandavilla in a pot that I want to transfer into a garden bed and apparently it needs well draining soil.

I performed a soil drainage test by digging a large hole and filling it with water. It took hours to drain so I think I have clay soil. How do I improve the soil drainage? Can I just buy a bag of propogation sand and mix it 50/50 with my current soil? I also heard mulch can help, I have heaps of sugar cane mulch at home that I put on top of my veggie garden to suppress weeds. Could I just mix that up in the soil to make it drain better?

Alternatively, could I just get rid of the existing soil and pour in a bag or two of all purpose garden soil? 

If I do add potting mix, sand, or mulch to my soil, how much of it do I have to put around and below the plant? Do I dig a hole, twice the size of its current pot? Three times the size? I can't dig very deep before I hit rock, but I have lots of horizontal space.

fydgyd,gardening,"Large plot, tons of weeds - help!","Hi all! On mobile so apologies for formatting. 

My fianc√© and I bought a house (we‚Äôre in South Africa) with a large yard. The whole plot is near 600sqm and the house itself is only around 80sqm. The yard is pretty barren - there‚Äôs some grass growing in patches and we‚Äôve started building some flower beds along the edges already. 

We have 2 main problems: 
1. Our soil is AWFUL. It‚Äôs basically sand and gravel and there are many patches where there‚Äôs more gravel than sand which we need to get rid of before we can work in better soil and compost etc. 
2. We have a LOT of weeds and a large variety of them. We‚Äôve managed to get rid of most of the stinging nettles and the weeds that grow like ground cover but there are two remaining types that are driving me mad: one makes ‚Äúdevil thorns‚Äù and another makes a round seed with little spokes that catches into the dogs fur and basically anything vaguely soft. 

I walk the garden almost daily and pull out what I can and we‚Äôve sprayed the whole yard down with a pretty strong weed killer but, as you can imagine, it gets expensive and is extremely time consuming. It might be worth noting a few things at this stage: we‚Äôve got a garden design that we‚Äôre planning on starting post-winter (which is coming up now and, in our area, is very wet and very cold) and we‚Äôre only planning a small area of lawn, which we‚Äôll buy in rolls and plant next winter for it to set. 

Basically, I don‚Äôt mind if everything dies except the flower beds (where the weed control is easier regardless). 

Wanted to hear if anyone has any ideas on how to get rid of these types of weeds at a large scale? Bonus if you have tricks to make moving the gravel easier too, but I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs one I‚Äôll just have to suck up! I was thinking that maybe laying down plastic for three or so weeks to stop any sunlight might be a good idea? Maybe after lay down newspaper with mulch over it and let the rain do it‚Äôs work to double as a weed killer and improve the soil quality? My worry is that this won‚Äôt kill the seeds and the problem will just come up again next year in better soil?",3,/r/gardening/comments/fydgyd/large_plot_tons_of_weeds_help/

fyz3vn,gardening,"Save Your Babies (tomatoes)! Don't Just Thin, Transplant the Lazy Way!","Hi all.  I hate tossing away perfectly good plants and I'm too lazy to wash/untangle the roots and repot.  So I do this every year and never remember to document/photo the results.  But this year I DID!

I try to put 2 seeds per pot when initially seeding.  Every year I get nearly 100% germination of my random tomato seeds (some saved from last year some commercial).  What I do when they grow about 4-6"" tall (or round) is to cut the smaller ones at the top of the soil and jam them into a new pot.  You can see the results after 9 days (day 7 missing, I don't know what happened to the photo :/ ).  I think I'll get 100% success with this batch of 12 transplants (one looks weak still but I think it'll survive).

 [https://imgur.com/a/0T80XsS](https://imgur.com/a/0T80XsS) 

Instructions:

1) Wait till seedlings are 4-6"" tall

1a) Make sure seedlings are well watered before the transplant (I didn't do this as I'm working 12 hour - 6 days weeks right now, so some were already a bit dehydrated, oops)

2) Cut right at soil (removing lower leaves optional, I actually only did this for the one shown)

3) Fill a new 2"" pot with soil and poke a hole to the bottom (or nearly so)

4) Plant tomato and fill hole with potting soil packing lightly

5) Keep soil soggy to encourage root growth

6) Keep humidity up with a dome (optional but also encourages root growth and prevents further dry out)

7) Watch them like a hawk to make sure soil stays soggy

7a) Yes they will look dead for about a week

8) Days 1 - 6 (contain your panic)

9) Day 7 BAM!  Your new seedlings are good to go.

9a) Note: Some may lag a bit

10) Find someone to pawn them off on cause you already have too many plants for your garden!

Hello,

I was just wondering if anyone could help or give me some. I recently planed some lavender and some of it isn‚Äôt thriving. I was wondering if there is anything I can do or how to determine when to give up on one of the lavenders and plant a new one.

So with the current quarantine I have time to work on my garden. I‚Äôve wanted a hedge of lavender for awhile so I bought some plugs.

I may have made a mistake, I didn‚Äôt plant them right away, I was busy that day so left them outside for a day. Could that have damaged them?

Some of them haven‚Äôt really grown and are dried out.  A few seem to be improving but others not so much.

Also, I ended up needing more lavender than I thought, so I had to buy more, because garden centres are shut right now I had to buy some bigger pots. Will the hedge even out in time, or will one side always be bigger than the other?

Thank you so much for your help.",3,/r/gardening/comments/fzyx6x/saving_lavender/

g0253k,gardening,Advice on how to deal with unwanted bamboo weed?,"Hi all. First time poster and complete novice gardener so excuse me for any poor terminology etc. Based in the UK is that has any impact on seasonality or product availability. 


I bought my home in June 2019. The garden is low maintenance with some wooden decking, a slab path to the gate and the rest covered in large gravel stones. There has been some minor weed growth amongst the gravel (on top of the fabric) which were very easy to pull out. Also some weeds along the fence line.


I have very recently spent some time painting my fence. To paint one side I had to sort out the weeds growing along it. and it was at this point I noticed the weeds growing appear to be a bamboo plant. It appears to have rooted and grown itself along the fence line and close to/under my house. It also has appeared to spread under the decking somewhat (a small growth through the wood decking, splitting the fabric under it and a very small growth at the path, coming from under paving slab. I found a dead thick bamboo stem about halfway along the fence line, presumably performed by the previous owners. This was fairly hidden as it had grown between the fence baseboards which had rotted away somewhat from the damage. 


For now I sprayed the foliage with roundup (glyphosate) and left for a week to turn mostly yellow then cut off the foliage growth and have sprayed those areas with roundup. I then painted my fence as planned (photos will show some brown paint I accidentally got on parts of the plant) 

I'm finding this is constantly plaguing my mind as what if it ends up taking over my garden or the growth that appears to be going towards my house walls ends up breaking foundations or similar or make the house unsaleable in the future.


Pics attached here with some annotations (I hope they make sense): https://m.imgur.com/a/x1vihVe


What is best approach to deal with this? I think a full dig up is impractical as would involve disassembling fence and decking and many days of physical effort or hiring someone in so wanting to stick towards weedkiller/management. 

Will this ever die completely or just something to manage indefinitely? 

Should I do anything specific about the root growing towards the wall? (may already be under the house) I was thinking to sever it and try to hollow it out a little and fill with roundup and seal it with tape or plastic or something. 

All advice appreciated. With the whole coronavirus situation and and being stuck indoors this is a real additional burden on my mind, making me miserable.",3,/r/gardening/comments/g0253k/advice_on_how_to_deal_with_unwanted_bamboo_weed/

g030x4,gardening,New to gardening in South Florida and just discovered my backyard is all sand. I would really appreciate any tips on improving soil quality and recommendations of sand-tolerant pants,"Since my work is closed during the quarantine I have been fixing things up around the house and now I‚Äôm on to the backyard. We have a small raised bed vegetable garden and deck. Now I want to plant some flowers along the fence line and clover ground-cover (instead of turf grass) in the remaining areas. 

After weeding and clearing the broken pavers/debris, I noticed that the soil is pretty much only sand under a thin layer of leaves. I‚Äôm thinking of digging a small, maybe 6in trench along the fence line and filling with garden soil and then spreading a thin layer of garden soil over the remaining areas (where I will plant clover). 

I am renting, plus money is a little tight with the lockdown so I am hoping I can do this for not much money. I found some ‚Äúscotts topsoil‚Äù and ‚Äúmiracle grow garden soil‚Äù on sale so I‚Äôm thinking of using a combo of the two? 

I‚Äôm also considering adding some inexpensive compost/manure but I‚Äôve never tried it. I also saw some ‚Äúsoil conditioner‚Äù and ‚Äúwater retention‚Äù additives. Are any of these effective/worth it?

Finally, I would love some recommendations on (full sun) flowers that don‚Äôt mind low-quality soil. Im thinking of maybe some salvias and milkweed?

g0344t,gardening,Should I be concerned for my in ground sown radish seedlings?,"Hello All,

First time growing Radishes, and I am a little concerned.

Yellow circled ones seem fine, blue circled ones seem to be struggling. We have had rain recently. Any thoughts on if I should cover them or do anything differently?

I believe the ones in the back which seem okay are a small radish, French breakfast, while the ones which seem leggy or upset are Daikon.

I mixed the ground soil in with high quality potting soil and some sand. While it was not amended to the ideal level, there was some additional nourishment added. I also added a fruit and veggie pellet style fertilizer. Could that have been the issue?

Thanks so much!!

g0blif,gardening,How to grow tomatoes?," Hi everyone,

I have never grown a plant in my life but I received a kit with a little pot and tomato seeds as a gift so I planted them. There were 20-25 seeds in the pack and I, not knowing if any of them would even grow, planted all of them in this tiny pot. It seems like most of them have started to sprout. Exciting, but worrisome because there are obviously way too many plants in this pot. Should I transfer them to a larger pot until they get a bit bigger and then plant them outside? Any tips on how to care for them?

I have a nice beautiful hydrangea shrub in my yard. Last year my neighbor taught me how to place a rock on the tall stems to propagate new hydrangea. I ended with a few sprouts that I was able to replant and they are doing well this year! I am trying this again and have a couple questions:

1. I may have cut the new hydrangea too early on two buds. By this I mean they had some new roots into ground but it may not have entirely cut itself from the mother plant. I‚Äôve since dug them up and added them to little planter to try to encourage rooting to grow. Currently it‚Äôs raining all day and I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll get rain overload so I have them under a larger covering where they‚Äôll get some rain but not all of it. Would I be better off letting them sit outside in rain in hopes they get a little sun today (no sun is out it appears all clouds but recognize some sun is still coming through). Thoughts? Know this is deep scenario.

2. Anyone ever have luck on the cut and root powder method? 

Not sure of right terms so I may be using odd ones to describe. I‚Äôm still newer to all this but love the idea of growing more hydrangea shrubs in my yard.

g1s40t,gardening,Seedling help,"Hi all,

Planted a few seeds this year to keep me busy during the summer and my first to really take hold were my cucumber with all 10 seeds germinating.

They seemed to germinate strong with all of them looking very healthy, green and look a nice size. However we are coming up to nearly 2 weeks with not a lot happening. I've been expecting the first set of true leaves but they just don't seem to be arriving!

Rather naively I planted all in one large pot and have since replanted them in their own individual pot - that was about 5 days ago. I have heard this stunts growth so might have delayed things? I have been keeping the in a conservatory type room that gets very warm in the sun and during the past few days of really nice weather in the UK I have had them outside in the sun.

Is there anything I can do to help speed these little fellas along or have I stunted them for good by transplanting them too early? Or am I just being a tad impatient?! 

I have also had a similar trouble with some tomato seedlings in the same conditions, however I can see the tiny first set of true leaves now developing on these over the past couple of days, no such luck with the cucumbers though. 

Thanks in advance!",3,/r/gardening/comments/g1s40t/seedling_help/

g24rse,gardening,Some advice for people starting a garden for the first time,"I set out last year to plant a native perennial garden. I had cleared an area, and left the plastic marker stakes in place after putting in my plants. I took pictures to show friends. Since these were perennial, I expected them to come back.

Well, I got behind on weeding, and some plants got lost. Some stakes broke over the winter. (and animals have pulled up some as well!) It remains to be seen what will actually return, though some things have already come back. But I'm now trying to reconstruct exactly what I planted where.

So let me recommend that you take good pictures of plants you expect to return. Even annuals, it might be worthwhile; I had a parsley plant that deer ate to the ground. Fortunately, it grew back!

g2e7yn,gardening,Seed germination unexpectedly fast - did I mess up?,"TLDR; My thyme, marjoram basil and lemon balm seeds all sprouted in just four days. Is that possible? They are in separate containers. 


On the 12th of this month (4 days ago), I put some seeds in separated plastic containers with premade soil mix. The only seeds I've ever tried to grow were Salvia officinalis, and two of them successfully germinated. That was last year. I was very new to gardening (still am, though I want to study gardening in two years), and I simply sprinkled a few seeds in potting mix and put it outside, watering it semi-regularly. I honestly don't know how they even survived.

This year I wanted to be a bit more serious about my seeds and bought some lemon balm, thyme, marjoram and basil seeds, as well as having the sage seeds I have from the previous year. There's still a risk of frost outside, so currently they're near my window in very warm temperature, as I have my heater on at night. I mist them with warm water every two hours or so, depending on how much the water evaporated, carefully water them in the evening and cover the containers with a plastic foil at night so they keep their moisture and heat.

Today I woke up and checked on my seeds, not expecting to see any sprouting yet at all. To my surprise, the thyme container was full of tiny seedlings, I could see a few taller basil seedlings in the basil box, a lot of sprouts in the marjoram box, and a few tiny ones in the lemon balm container. No sprouts in the sage one. Is it possible for these seeds to germinate that fast? I do care for them often, making sure they don't dry out or drown too much, and the warmth is adequate I think. But I've heard that both thyme and marjoram have much longer germination times than 4 days, and yet these containers have the most seedlings. I got worried if I messed up and some seeds from maybe the lemon balm got into the other containers, as I've read it has a shorter germination time, but I took great care when sowing them, and I'm quite confused.

I put down cardboard, about a half inch of grass clippings, about 5 inches of shredded bark, another half inch of grass clippings, about 4 inches of compost, and then another inch or two of mulch to keep out weeds. Come this spring, I have aerated the soil with a digging fork, added some more fertilizer, and removed to top layer of mulch to let the soil warm up.

My question is, do you think the layer of shredded bark under the compost will eat up too much nitrogen for vegetables to grow this spring/summer?

In the middle, there is an interesting setup but I find it a bit messy, first I have no idea on how to take care of this, second I have 2 kids and this takes a lot of space for them to walk and play around, so I had the idea of removing this and use some vases more to the sides.

g41lrj,gardening,Dealing with compacted soil with possibly high clay content?,"Looking for advice on how to deal with compacted soil in my yard!

It's very compacted from years of neglect (bought this place last year) and I believe has a large clay content because it keeps balling up into clumps that take a fingerprint easily. 

My ultimate goal is to re-grade and flatten most of my yard, and plant clover. Most vegetables and flowers will be put in raised beds as an aesthetic choice. Also may need to add some French drains but that's a different topic. 

Anyway I started tilling by hand with a large pickax (and am now dying). I was able to break up most of the larger balls of dirt but am I right that -- without supplementing it -- it will just compact again due to the clay content?

If that's the case, what can I add cheaply to remedy it? I have a very very very large compost pile of very rich soil I would like to use, but it's mostly broken down at this point (not many leaves or ruffage left). Any other options I can get at a store cheaply? 

Finally, after I amend the soil, is there any reason not to just rent a roto tiller?

g47frw,gardening,Zone six planters: How early can we start putting planting our tender cuccurbit crops outdoors?,"Hello all,

I really tried to go early this year; now I am slightly regretting it. I have these pumpkin plants that recently got their first baby pumpkin fruit, and they are still indoors in light of the cold weather. I live in northern KY where it is supposed to get down to freezing again this week. These plants are getting to large for indoors(one of them is probably \~5-6 ft long!) and they are still in tiny(\~600ml) pots. I also have some goards that are getting really tall(these things grow like trees at first!) and I really want them to thrive and grow on a trellis.

Does anyone else here cope with this same problem? I have a whole shelving unit taken over by cucurbits, and some of them(mainly the pumpkins) are starting to yellow on the lower leaves due to lack of nutrients and not enough space for the roots. In your experience, is it okay to put these things outside when the temperature still plummets below 50F on a regular basis?

A greenhouse would really be useful at this point in time. As a newbie gardener, I am really starting to hate late frost!

I planned on placing them on a table, in front of a window, that gets 6-8ish hours of sunlight per sunny day.

1) I live in a neighborhood with quite a few cats. Will the heads be deep enough in the ground to keep them from trying to dig them up and ruining my garden in the process?


2) Is this method viable in pots? I grow my tomatoes in large pots, and they seem to have a few worms in them, but I'm worried that this will not be enough to break down the fish heads.

Prior to today I had no idea what an African Daisy was or Hollyhocks, but I would love and hear some suggestions on other plants to make this more presentable year round.  I do have working sprinklers in most of the hill, I am in Los Angeles, I am pretty much open to anything, I have no idea which direction to go, although I do like the mostly mulch with a few patches of plants look.

I started some shallots in my apartment in early March - I live in a cold climate and wanted to get a good head start. They came up easily and the sprouts were thriving for 2-3 weeks, but this past week they all shriveled and started to get dry and anemic. I fertilized them as recommended, too. Didn‚Äôt matter how moist I kept them, how much sun they got, etc. All but one of them died.

I planted a bunch more last week and they‚Äôve just sprouted. I have 2 weeks until the last frost date where I live and plan to put them in my garden plot as soon as it warms up. 

Thoughts on why my first batch died? I‚Äôd like to make sure this group stays healthy! My only idea was that perhaps I planted them too early and they used up all the limited nutrients in the soil, since they were in such a small container. 

Thank you!!

UPDATE in case anyone comes across this post in the future: The solution is to cut the shallot sprouts down when they get too leggy to make sure the plant‚Äôs energy is going into the below-ground part and not the leaf!

g5km17,gardening,Need advice to not kill already established apple trees that are too close together,"We moved into a place a year ago and it had a couple nice fruit trees already planted. The landlord is weirdly not specific about how to care about them - he just says ""give them water"" and that is it.   


The ones that I am concerned about are a semi-dwarf golden delicious and a semi-dwarf fuji. For some reason, they are planted VERY close together. The GD seems to be growing well, but the Fuji seems stunted. Last year they grew fruit, but they were TINY (more so than what I would assume is semi-dwarf) and they weren't super good.   


My question: Is there a safe way to transplant a tree elsewhere without screwing it up too much? Is that a good idea to get them less crowded? Also, generally how do I care for them? Do I need to do anything to treat the soil, and how often and how much should I water them? Help me where my landlord has not :)

g5lgju,gardening,Small holes all over lawn. What is making them?,"https://imgur.com/a/P3dUYdn

I noticed these a few nights ago. Shortly after sunset I was walking around the yard and noticed something small (like a beetle maybe) scurry into one of these holes as I approached. Then I noticed the holes were everywhere. I walked around the yard and at one point noticed a hole where something was sticking out of it about an inch or so. As I walked closer it went back into the hole quickly, as if it felt my footsteps and sensed danger. 

I tried walking very gently around to ""sneak up"" on them using a flashlight, but again they seem to be scared of the light and retreated when I'd shine it on them. Looks like possibly some kind of worm sticking out of the hole, but they retreat so quickly that I can't get a good look.

I've briefly Googled them but can't find anything definitive. One site mentioned some kinds of ground burrowing bees and wasps leave holes like this. But it also said if it was bees you'd likely see them flying over the holes during the day, and I have not noticed that.

The only water outlet is by the house, so anything I bring to the garden would have to be ran via a regular hose (I'd say about 20 feet?) I'm so far looking at either soaker hoses or drip irrigation. And I just can't decide. Drip seems to be the most water conserving route, but soaker hoses are cheaper and seem would be easier to clean up come fall - our winters are freezing and the first freeze can hit out of the blue so I need something that isn't going to take ages to drain and put away.

I've thought about installing drip irrigation or soaker hoses, but I've got seven 4'x12' raised beds and four 20' in-ground rows and I think it would just be cost prohibitive a that point(or not?), plus I genuinely enjoy the act of watering and it gives me a chance to check on everything. Unfortunately, the water pressure in the backyard is admittedly high, so our current hose is ""heavy duty"" and thick (although I question if this is *really* necessary) and I still need at least 75 feet in length because I have to reach plants in the very opposite corner of the garden. I don't know if I need a self-winding reel or just another type of hose but I can't imagine my problem is unique. Can you please share what some of your solutions to this problem have been?

g6fgjo,gardening,Looking for advice on vines!,"Hi folks,

Long story short I'm looking for a fast growing vine for an indoor art installation. I'm in North America (Canada) and hoping to find something that can grow about 3-5ft up a trellis in 3 months or so. 

I'm having a hard time working out if it's possible. I was looking at Virginia Creeper but there's not a whole lot of information on how much vining plants grow in their first year.

It'll be growing in a raised bed in a gallery so I don't think there's very much risk of it spreading (which I believe is usually a consideration for vines outdoors). I'll also be using grow lights as there won't be any natural light.

Any ideas? Does this sound possible? Thanks in advanced. Really appreciate any help!",3,/r/gardening/comments/g6fgjo/looking_for_advice_on_vines/

A friend who works for the ag extension recommended cutting them down and driving copper nails into the stumps. Theory being it will draw copper ions through the root system and fry them off (like root kill, but without endangering the other plants nearby).

I‚Äôve been growing the plants inside in a propagator and they are getting quite tall now (a couple inches). I read that if growing them inside I should take them out for a few hours when they reach this height to train them to be wind resistant, but sadly when I did I think the sun was too strong for them and few plants didn‚Äôt survive that. (well, they‚Äôre still standing but strongly wilted and looking sad - some survived and are thriving indoors though). 

I‚Äôm looking for some advice on what I should do next? Shall I move them to larger pots (they‚Äôre still in the small pots i started them in) inside and put them out for a few hours a day (shaded)?

I put together a little seed starting station for myself with items I already had around the house (except the bulbs and trays) and it can be viewed here: [https://imgur.com/a/sblYe21](https://imgur.com/a/sblYe21)

&amp;#x200B;

I thought at first the space would be perfect, but now I'm having doubts. This setup is in my basement and it is pretty chilly down here most of the time (16¬∫C/60¬∫F). If I use the cups I have pictured for pots, the lid will obviously not fit on the trays. I could probably cut them smaller, but would the plants just outgrow them before I could get them outside if I do? (My season starts late May). Is the lid even necessary?

&amp;#x200B;

The bigger issue I see of course, is that there's not a lot of wiggle room to move that light fixture up and down on the chain as the plants grow. I'm planning on starting cauliflower, broccoli, broccoli, and 3 types of peppers (Jalapeno, Thai Dragon &amp; Yolo Wonder) - how big can I expect them to get in the 4-6 weeks they'll be living in there?  


I could take this apart, insert taller uprights, and move it to another location - I was just hoping this place would work. I also have plans for a timer &amp; fan if anyone was wondering...

I thought I might have overwatered so I cut back on that a ton, and sprayed them with copper soap in case it's fungus. They currently don't have a drain hole, but that too worked fine last year. I just try not to water so there is any water sitting on the bottom.

g98bbi,gardening,Lilac Advice,"Hey all,

So we moved into this house about 3.5 years ago and I am really only getting around to taking the gardens seriously now that I have some (corona)time.

Between the neighbour and us there is a long bed with three fairly mature lilacs in it. The bed, though full of nice flowers, was in a state of disrepair when we inherited it and I've not done a lot to it since.

This year I am cleaning it out, weeding already, and plan to add to the bed. The lilacs are a constant question though. They do bloom, though I doubt as healthily as they could/should.

[Here are pics of the lilacs](https://imgur.com/a/PA0GvUm), the photo quality may be fine but on a gray day like this the detail may not stand out well.

My wife has suggested a scorched earth policy with them, and just cutting them down to two feet and letting them regrow - I am hopeful that aggressive but careful pruning can bring them back. 

The third of them (hard to see in photos) I pruned a few years ago and it seems to have been good for it, and already this year I have pulled out several dead and rotting ""trunks"" from the midst of the two front ones that were so loose in the soil I could yank them out with one hand. I have also begun to prune shoots coming up at the roots/very low down.

They are obviously a bit overgrown, but I am just not sure what it is I need to prune for optimal health?

Should I cut off all of those dead and dried flower heads? Is this ""deadheading"", or is that something else?

Should I cut the branches back on the sides where they're sticking out?/What kind of pruning should I be doing?

Should I be adding compost or fertilizer on top of the roots where those rotten ones came out to give more nutrients and to build up the soil strength?

Thank you for any help and suggestions.",3,/r/gardening/comments/g98bbi/lilac_advice/

g9iaks,gardening,Potted trees in backyard suggestion,"Hi folks.   Relatively new to the sub.    I would like to call myself a novice gardener, or maybe a yard worker is more appropriate.   I work a relatively stressful and physically demanding job which I love but when I‚Äôm home, aside from spending time with my family, nothing pleases me more than yard work, which I like to pretend is gardening.   I call what I do yard work versus gardening because I love paying attention to every small detail of my yard.   I‚Äôll try to throw a picture up tomorrow.   I‚Äôll mow, edge, aerate, prune, shape, weed, separate every pea gravel rock from the tanbark, leaf blow, then powerwash only to have to start all over again as soon as I‚Äôm done.     It‚Äôs a vicious cycle and I absolutely love it.    I‚Äôll throw on a podcast breaking down the NBA salary cap for the next 4 years and work for hours.    The cherry on top is when my 3 and 5 year old get their buckets out and help me pick up fallen leaves.    I refrain from calling myself a real gardener because I‚Äôm not as knowledgeable as to the types of trees or plants I‚Äôve come to learn to care for.     I‚Äôm always very impressed when I talk to someone who has in depth knowledge on plants.   Those are the gardeners in my opinion.   

As for the reason I‚Äôm here.   I‚Äôm looking for suggestions for a tree that would do well in a large potted plant.    Green leafed preferred.   I have several 8‚Äô Japanese maples and a beautiful smoke tree that provides a fair amount of red to the yard with deep green Italian Cypress trees as a back drop.   The area I‚Äôd like to fill in in on a concrete patio next to a gazebo.    Something in the 4-7 foot range I think would be ideal sitting in a large pot.   I‚Äôm in the SF Bay Area to give climate zone reference.     I‚Äôve been thinking about an Olive tree.   I have no idea on how to properly care for one yet though.    Do they lose their leaves annually?    Are there any other trees any of you kind folks could suggest to look into?   The main purpose of the tree is to offer some balance and bring some verticality to the yard.    Shade isn‚Äôt a driving force in this.    There‚Äôs a 7 foot in ground 15 year old lemon tree and a small potted line tree in the yard already.  Fruit isn‚Äôt a driving force either.    This is purely esthetics.     Again, any suggestions would be appreciated.   Thanks for the time.",3,/r/gardening/comments/g9iaks/potted_trees_in_backyard_suggestion/

g9ndoz,gardening,What to put between raised beds?,"Hello all,

Our side yard is mostly but not 100% divided into raised beds. Right now in between the beds we have ‚Äúgrass‚Äù (in quotes because it‚Äôs mostly weeds and crabgrass).  Of course, this leads to crabgrass and other things seeding over the top and needing to do more raised bed weeding.

Aesthetically, what would look best between the beds?

Mulch?
Gravel?
Stones? (Either large ones or like river stones)

Mostly I want to create a neater appearing raised bed area and also decrease weeds.

Any opinions?

I can post a pic if needed but it‚Äôs a standard raised bed layout I think (three 4‚Äôx4‚Äôs, one L-shaped 4‚Äôx12‚Äô, one straight 4‚Äôx12‚Äô).

I have not seen any other buds on about 10 other tulips that have popped up and all are about the size that should have produced a bud if they were going to. My understand is that because the tulips were mowed over year after year for the last 15 years the bulbs are weak from not being able to store energy (no leaves = no stored energy for a flower the next year). My question is can old bulbs recover from this if you allow them to fully grow their leaves again or am I better off just ripping these out and planting new ones in the fall?

All of the trees shown are ultra dwarf or dwarf.  Left side planted 7 years ago.  Hillside trees in 4 years ago and the middle trees 2 years ago minus the Myers.

Off the picture is a 60 ft x 6 ft trellis line with green beans, string beans, snow peas, sugar snags, cucumbers, lemon cucumbers and a super sweet tomato plant on each end and they're in 15 gallon pots.  You can see the pole for the right side of the trellis on the left side of the pic. 

Also not showing is an avocado tree, blood orange tree, almond tree , Surinamese cherry tree, 2 other raspberry bushes, 1 more blackberry bush and one more blueberry bush.     Also have a 4th planter box for onions, bunching onions, radishes &amp; turnips.   And about 10 x 15 gallon pots for Broccoli, Brussel Sprouts, Eggplant, Crookneck Squash, Acorn Squash and Butternut squash.

Have 32 smaller 14"" pots planted with 7 types of lettuce and 2 pots with horseradish in them.

Oh.... I planted some grapes this year too.  Excited to see how those come out on a walkway trellis so the grapes hang down in the walkway.  If they work out I'll plant my entire 200 ft hilltop fence line with grapes and start trying to make some wine.

g9smiq,gardening,Help with my tomatoes?,"I‚Äôm not a seasoned gardener, I want to preface that. I purchased some (healthy looking at the time) tomato plants. Two were ~5 inches tall, all green, no yellow or brown, and the other two were the same but about 8 inches tall. The taller ones were moved into their final pots (a 30x40 inch bin) and are doing well (I keep rotating the bin as they lean towards the sun and I don‚Äôt want them to become heavy on one side). 

The smaller ones are experiencing yellowing and browning at their leaf tips, though. I don‚Äôt really understand what‚Äôs going on. I thought perhaps the move from the retail pot into a new pot might have shocked them a little. It‚Äôs been a week and a half and it hasn‚Äôt really gotten significantly worse but it hasn‚Äôt really gotten better, either. 

https://imgur.com/a/AS4ytlJ/

This is what they look like. The soil is pretty moist, it‚Äôs not like ‚Äúdamp‚Äù where it would stick to your finger but it‚Äôs not dry where it‚Äôs clumping either. 

My first thought was that maybe they need more water after a transplant, and I‚Äôve been starving them? Except I know that overwatering can cause it‚Äôs own problems. Should I give them a big soak and see what happens, or should I hold off?

furnkc,gardening,Soil for Raised Bed," Attempted posting on my Alt Account, but was instantly removed.

I've recently started my own garden, and I've run into a bit of a problem. I want to use raised steel beds, but you need quite a large amount of soil to fill them. For most people, it's no hassle to just order some soil from a Landscape Supplies place, but my backyard and most of my front yard is totally inaccessible by car, much less a truck used for transporting soil. Even if we could squeeze a truck into the front yard, there's nowhere to dump it all.

My local soil is also worthless, my backyard soil is too heavy with clay, so much so that the Strawberry bed I've already put in (It's smaller and was filled with a bagged mix) is struggling to drain the water, I literally have not watered it since I bought them months ago - the soil is not just moist, it is wet.

Has anyone else encountered a similar situation? Is my only option to make back and forth trips to Bunnings to buy cheap bagged mixes and inevitably have that add up to hundreds of dollars?",23,/r/gardening/comments/furnkc/soil_for_raised_bed/

Put it in a pot please! It is highly evasive in nearly every area! I'm sure Greenland probably struggles with mint growing wild! I've spent the last 4 years clearing out my community garden plot and like clockwork........mint keeps coming back every year no matter what I put down or do. Someone planted it x amount of years ago and I've been yanking it all up since. Last year I got every possible root/leave/rhinestone I could find. Dug down deep and pulled it all up. Threw down garden fabric, then cardboard, then manure and let it sit all winter long. Only to find that, mint has pushed their roots through it all and now I have mint infested cardboard!  

So please, help a waffle out! Keep mint in the pot. It is virtually indestructible, it can probably thrive in a closet. it will do fine on your steps/kitchen window/etc.",23,/r/gardening/comments/g4sq8p/psa_for_those_first_time_gardners_who_want_to/

g3ba4g,gardening,Dad has MS and can no longer walk or be outside. Looking for a gift idea that will allow him to garden again. Any ideas?,"Hi /r/gardening!

I hope I came to the right place. I didn't see any rules preventing me from posting this...

My dad has MS. He's not able to walk anymore or spend much time outside. He can however use his upper body no problem and get around fine with his wheelchair.

I've been buying him random gifts the last few years trying to inspire a new hobby, but nothing has worked. My newest attempt is getting him started on an old hobby: gardening. I'm looking for some sort of intro kit I can buy him that allows him to garden inside. I'd like to keep the gift anywhere from $25 - 250, but I'm open to paying more if necessary. It's just hard to justify spending more than that given how unsuccessful I've been in the past.

Before I buy a random kit online, any recommendations? Should I buy a kit like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Indoor-Garden-Pepper-Seed-Starter/dp/B07X2Z7H3W/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=indoor+garden+kit&amp;qid=1587158106&amp;sr=8-3) or maybe buy a lamp like [this](https://www.amazon.com/AeroGarden-901100-1200-Harvest-Black/dp/B07CKK8Z78/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=indoor+garden+kit&amp;qid=1587158430&amp;sr=8-1) and seeds?

Also, if it matters, my parents live in TN, which has every season. Summer is hot and humid. I DO NOT want to buy him something however that will require him to go outside.

Thank you in advance! I am confident this is my best idea yet and I'm super optimistic it will stick",22,/r/gardening/comments/g3ba4g/dad_has_ms_and_can_no_longer_walk_or_be_outside/

g8dt0j,gardening,Please stop shopping at garden centers during lockdown. It's not essential.,"I have the pleasure of working at a garden center attached to a larger hardware store chain found throughout the Midwest. Normally this is a pretty great job as I love plants and it's very rewarding to help other people with the same passion. 

While there are always a few bad guests I have never been so disgusted by both the people continuing to shop here and the companies pretty much non-existent safety measures. Grass seed is not an essential item, neither is patio furniture. It's not, if you want to make the argument that things like vegetable seeds or seedlings are because they are used for food fine, I can completely understand that, however having a small vegetable garden in your yard is not your only food source and is most likely not even a major one. I'm not saying that I think we should be closed or that no one should be shopping here, but there are things like order pick-up that help minimize human contact. If you insist on going into a store don't just wander around, get your things and leave. 

There is literally no way I can practice social distancing when people are crammed together and the store has a 500 person cap. That's more people than there are carts in our store. They have not provided most of us with PPE despite being told they would. I received a small pay bump,effective only on weekdays, which still has me earning below a living wage and I can not afford to take sick leave should I become sick. The company has also continued to accept returns throughout the pandemic. 
Now is not the time to redo your yard because you have free time, not all of us have the privilege of working from home during this. I don't want to die helping entitled people pick out petunias  for under 15 an hour. 
Please stop and think about those of us stuck dealing with your whims during this whole thing.",21,/r/gardening/comments/g8dt0j/please_stop_shopping_at_garden_centers_during/

I wanted to do a big garden this year but never again will I bother with Burpee.  Learned my lesson.

Edit:  yes I know there is a pandemic, so does Burpee.  If they can't handle the orders then all they have to do is stop taking orders.

g49s2d,gardening,Trying to learn to garden. No guidance from the community and my mom is gone. Help.,"I'm hoping to find out more about gardening. My mom was an amazing gardener growing up and I did help her. So I'm not entirely without experience. I live in Zone 6a, and we're literally right next to the Ohio river. So there are a lot of variables that I feel like I'm just not knowledgeable enough to tackle without some guidance. Unfortunately my mother died young and my father and his wife don't like me to come around my childhood home. I can't ask her questions and I have no idea really what kind of tools or things my mom used as a staple. I feel totally in the dark. 

  
Once I was told to seek out my local garden club because they would have a good idea what it's like to grow in this environment. I tried to be apart of the community a few years back but the group ended up being more about drinking and gossip than actual gardening. I've also visited local nurseries to gleam some knowledge from gardeners there. But It felt very cliquey and They didn't seem interested in helping someone who was new to the community. All in all, I feel like I've run out of local ideas and so I'm here on Reddit hoping someone can help or point me in the right direction. 

  
I should say that I make pottery for a living and I have a pretty good idea that the soil around my house is high in clay. Which I think would make sense being so close to a major river. 

  
I was going to contact a local lawn company about ordering top soil. I was planning of digging down where my garden beds will be, laying down topsoil. and blending it into the natural soil. then pile more topsoil on top. That should help my plants have a good starting point right? And by the time the roots reach past the nutritious topsoil they will be strong enough to deal with the high clay soil. Right?

  
As far as what to grow... are there plants that are like famously durable? I tried to grow some hydrangea bushes when I moved in and they died in record time. Are there plants that grow well around rivers? Or that can withstand super flooded/saturated soil for a week or two each year?  
I've got plans for flower beds around our house and also a vegetable garden. Is one easier to do than the other?

&amp;#x200B;

So if anyone could give any help at all that would be amazing. I tried to see if there was a sticky-ed post about basics or something but I couldn't see anything. I saw the Friday question post but I was worried about posting such a long questions in a post that already has over 200 comments. Let me know if this is against the rules and I'll take this down.

fsyp7o,gardening,"Who else gets ""blackberry winter""? How do you adjust your gardening plans for it?","[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackberry_winter)

Today in central Alabama (zone 7b) we woke up to a frost after a week of hot weather.  Our average last date of frost is April 3-ish.  However we also get a phenomenon known as ""Blackberry Winter"" where another cold snap/potential frost hits between April 10-ish and April 15-ish.  Not every year, but often.

Who else gets a blackberry winter?  What name does it go by in your part of the country?  And how do you adjust your gardening for it?  

Here we have to be really careful about not planting certain things, like tomatoes, before the danger of blackberry winter has passed.  This year I'm trying to get an earlier start on certain things - mostly annuals direct-sown outdoors - and I'm wondering how to take blackberry winter into account for seeds.  Any advice?",2,/r/gardening/comments/fsyp7o/who_else_gets_blackberry_winter_how_do_you_adjust/

ft1wlt,gardening,Re-doing the compost!,"I've joined a friends community garden space and there are a couple of old compost piles which are full of the following:

\- Japanese Knotweed (roots).

\- Some Blackberrys (some dead, some growing)

\- Various other weeds

\- Turf

\- Soil and rocks.

I can also get hold of lots of low-quality earth. 

I've bought a couple of new bins. I would love to do two things. 1. Give my new compost the best start. 2. Get rid of the old bins and reuse as much material as possible.

Could I burn the wood, Japanese knotweed roots and Blackberrys, then using the ash in the new compost. Then, anything else without the knotweed or Blackberrys could go into the new bins too, plus the low-quality earth (maybe).

ftbis5,gardening,Zone 8-9 Autumn vege seed planting - Southern Hemisphere.,"Hi

Hate to jump on the bandwagon but my countries in lockdown. I normally just get a few seedlings from the garden centre and I‚Äôve never been to serious about it. Now I can‚Äôt buy seedlings, only seeds due to the lockdown and this situation has made me realise I really should grow more of my own food, it‚Äôs ridiculous that I don‚Äôt, I have a lot of space and enough time.


I have prepared the garden patches by liming then during the summer (and then leaving them to grow weeds ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). Yesterday I weeded them and mixed in 1.5 wheel barrow loads of rotted horse poo per 3m2 and 1 handful of blood and bone per m2. 
I have a bit of rotted mulch made from calf shed bedding should I add that too or will it be to high in nitrate with the horse poo even though it‚Äôs rotted down?
 

I have 6m2 or maybe 9m2 to plant in the vege garden mostly full sun with a bit of afternoon shade at the end of one patch. I can convert more lawn into vege garden easily, but maybe I‚Äôll just see how I go this year with what I have. 


Also I have a patch in an old berry cage I could plant but it looks very infertile - mossy and compacted despite liming. I could mix mulch thru but I‚Äôm out of horse poo for now. I was thinking spuds or something in there.


The season up til now has been very dry and hot, but we appear to have turned a corner and it‚Äôs started to rain. The leaves on the trees are just starting to turn and the majority of days currently are a sunny 18 degrees Celsius down to 9 overnight.


What seeds should I buy? Please make suggestions, we get frosts and I don‚Äôt have a tunnel house. I can raise a few inside if I have to as I have quite a few seed trays and pots.

Then it dawned on me that I have yet to figure out what does need vine need done.  After looking online I am only more confused. Most of what I read was either on starting a vine or what to do at the beginning or end of seasons.  Do I need to prune it aggressively?  Do I need to just try to train it as is?

ftfwx0,gardening,How Not To Replant,"Because of the coronavirus I've decided to start gardening with some flowers and some herbs. I have a little pot of cilantro that I've been growing from seeds. This cilantro sprouted quite energetically with tiny little cilantro leaves. 

Well, this bush of cilantro was outgrowing its pot. So I got a bigger pot. Decided to replant the cilantro sprouts in there.

(I have never replanted something in my life.)

I lift the mass out of the smaller pot and it immediately falls apart. Dirt goes everywhere. The sprouts fell apart. All I saw were scraggily little roots.

Well okay.

I struggle to get the sprouts upright, bundle them together, and dig the deepest hole that would fit them. Once the bundles of cilantro sprouts were sorta planted in their holes (although they didn't stand up anymore), I tried to even out the soil in an attempt at support.

This whole thing resulted in some really rough looking planting that will probably kill them all because of shock.

I have maybe six cucumber seedlings (delikatessen cucumbers - small and good for pickling). They're not very tall - about four inches, still in their peat pots - but they have beautiful, massive, dark green leaves and are growing fast. I've removed a few spindly runners already. Now, even though they're so very tiny, the bigger ones have started producing small flower buds in lots of places. I've read not to prune them until they get between one and two feet tall, but wouldn't I get better growth if I nip these buds and let them get taller and older before they flower and fruit?

fu7ny1,gardening,Is it possible for a freshly cut tree trunk to live without roots and drink water and liquid fertilizer directly through the bottom where it was cut? Can I successfully use rooting hormone on it?,"So at the beginning of March, I realized my little mulberry tree (5 y/o) HAD to be cut down, as its trunk got too big for the fence and was pushing against it. I didn‚Äôt know it was going to get that big. It takes about ten years for a mulberry tree to reach full maturity and start bearing fruit, so I was understandably saddened by this.

It was too much trouble for me to try to uproot and transplant it, because the root system on that thing is HUGE. Well, being March, there were no leaves on any of the trees. But now, being April, all the leaves are starting to grow back‚Äîeven on the actual trunk of the tree that was cut down. It‚Äôs been pouring down cats and dogs lately, flooding quite a bit... Was the log able to absorb water from that even without any roots? I noticed the log is actually now budding, with large green leaves that are starting to unfurl. I‚Äôm wondering if it somehow would be possible to feed it a liquid fertilizer/water mixture and it absorb it without roots, and survive?

I'm thinking a tiered triangular layout (it will be positioned in a corner). Has anyone done a triangular layout? Does anyone have strong feelings towards a rectangular layout instead? 

I am likely going to keep it a simple salad garden (peppers, cucs, tomato, greens, carrots). Especially since I am sharing the produce with my coworkers that I want all to enjoy. Any suggestions regarding your best planting experiences in a raised bed?

Also, it will be on asphault. I'm concerned about the reflective heat affecting the plants. I'm considering putting it on stilts or creating some sort of buffer. I work in tree care so we have plenty of wood chips I could use as a buffer. Thoughts?

fudbsw,gardening,I need some advice on how to take over my mom‚Äôs garden.,"https://imgur.com/a/M5WkAkz

Background: my mother was an amazing gardener and had the greenest thumb you could imagine. She was a nurturing person by nature and loved her gardening almost as much as she loved her kids. 

However, she passed away in December after battling an aggressive breast cancer for only a year. Because of how sick she was the summer before she passed, her garden was neglected. 

Now that spring has arrived and my grief has settled in, I know my moms wouldn‚Äôt want her garden and backyard to look as bad as it does right now. I‚Äôve done my best to get in there and clean it up but I have absolutely no idea what I‚Äôm doing. I need some advice. I want to plant grass, but there are so many wood chips that I have no idea what to do with them. I‚Äôve started piling woodchips and yard waste in some black garbage bags but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the correct way to do it and/or if I could still plant grass with the wood chips still there. I don‚Äôt know what to do with all the small pots lying around (nothing seems to be alive) and how exactly to go about cleaning this up. The only thing I know for sure is that I want to keep the strawberry patch.

Also, how much of the yard waste can I put in the compost tumblr?

fuiehq,gardening,"Curly willow branches, rooting question.","Hey folks!
I got some curly willow branches from my work, since nobody has been buying them they've all grown roots which is super cool. I'd like to try turning them into full trees, I have five and they were not expensive so I'm willing to do some plant experiments.

My thought was to let them root in water a little longer. The branches are about four feet long, and rather thin, and the roots are only a few inches long and they don't have the offshoots yet. Then I was gonna start adding small amounts of soil into the bucket until they're better established and then plant. 

But I've seen folks talking about trees and root flare, and I've also got the feeling that four foot long thin branches aren't going to make a sturdy tree just like that, so I'd appreciate some advice, especially if you've done this before. 

I'm also a bonsai novice and love getting the chance to mess around with a tree from time to time. Hoping maybe one day one of these branches will turn into a workable bonsai, but I'm not banking on it lol.",2,/r/gardening/comments/fuiehq/curly_willow_branches_rooting_question/

furdon,gardening,Newbie Seeking Advice on Patio Garden (Herbs and Salsa),"Hello,

My housemate and I have minimal gardening experience, and looking to create a low maintenance patio garden, mostly for herbs and salsa. Please help us to prioritize how to go about this. Also, which containers and soil are likely best here in San Diego. Which should be watered daily and those not as often? Which should be planted right next to each other and which not?


SALSA

Tomatoes (I love tomatoes a lot and can eat raw, on sandwiches and in salsa).

Onions (I assume we are better off buying store ones)

Cilantro

Peppers (which peppers are best; some medium and some hot salsa)
I am used to Jalapeno, Serrano, and Habanero for a cheese dip I make but am always open to trying something new. Maybe add some bell peppers as well?


HERBS (do not need to do them all)

Cilantro (previously listed above)

Basil

Chives

Green Onion

Dill

Parsley

Mint

Thyme

Rosemary

Sage

Tarragon

Oregano

Garlic


I am fairly new to San Diego and not sure which of these will grow year round in this area. Maybe we should use something we can wheel inside if it gets too cold, or just have something to cover it and keep outside?

Before removing anything from this list, are there any other items we should consider adding? We do not have a ton of space.


This or something similar seems promising...

I moved them over to pots 14in in diameter and used a potting mix from Home Depot and I am struggling with them. Although the Yellow Mushrooms seem to be doing fine.  

So how often should I be watering my potted peppers? Its currently 80 degrees here. I also try to give them as much sun as possible.

What are signs of over and under watering them? 

What are signs of needing more nutrients? 

Can I over feed plants with organic fertilizers?

fvgo62,gardening,"Raised bed woes - crabgrass and compacted soil, what to do?","Hi all - When I built my raised bed garden around 4 years ago, I got a mixture of 1/3 constuction sand, 1/3 topsoil, 1/3 horse manure to fill the bed, and things have been growing pretty well.  At the beginning of each season, I would bust up all of the dirt with a pitchfork to make it fluffier for planting (I realized recently this was probably a mistake and I was destroying the soil structure and leading to compaction).

Last year, my tomatoes did fine, but bell peppers did really poorly, and I think the dense soil underneath them may have been part of the problem.  Small seeded crops like beets and spinach really, really struggled - I got horrible germination and seedlings not being able to poke up because when the top layer of soil dried it was super dense.

What can I do about this?  For peppers, I was thinking about digging deeper planting holes in each spot where a transplant will go, and replacing it with a bunch of fluffy compost, to give a good space, maybe up to half a cubic foot or so, for the roots to branch out.  And over time, hopefully the addition of compost ameliorates some of the compaction.  For seeded crops, maybe adding an inch of compost to the entire surface...? Any thoughts?

Also, due to some local HoA issues when I was first setting the beds up, I didn't have time to properly kill the grass around/underneath the beds, and now I've got grass growing up through most of them (see pic).  Is there something I can do about this in preparation for the season, or am I doomed to eternally weed and pick it as it grows?

Thanks.

fvjpza,gardening,Advice needed please regarding which trees to plant - UK 9a zone,"Hi, 

I was hoping someone here would be able to give me some advice regarding trees?

I have a north facing garden in the UK (Zone 9a) and would like to plant some trees at the top of my garden. This is for privacy as well being the only part of the garden my wife hasn't already planted. Plants are her speciality not trees.... 

The soil type is well drained and chalky and the trees would be partially sheltered from the wind by a wall and fence. 

Ideally I would like 2 or 3 trees that will give some privacy without growing to the extent they will cause my neighbours issues. The neighbours aren't the best in all honesty, but Jesus wants me for a sunbeam so I'm trying to avoid planting a row of towering behemoth's however tempting it may be. 

I'd like to avoid conifers if possible and dont mind if the trees are evergreen or deciduous. Anything that would be beneficial to wildlife would be a huge bonus. 

I've looked online (garden centres are closed at the moment due to the coronavirus) and the choices are huge, which makes it even more difficult to decide because I don't know what I'm looking for!

I'm hoping that it's possible to find trees that are around 6ft when purchased/planted to provide privacy sooner rather than later.

1. Anti-bird/squirrel cage
2. Solution for tying tomatoes up
3. Create a frame to make a greenhouse.

The cage sits on top of the cedar raised bed.  Its made of pressure treated pine, 1"" chicken wire, and outdoor wood screws. The side panels with the horizontal bars can be removed for easy access.  The poles along the top are for tying tomatoes.

Total cost is probably $150, which needs to come down.

Citrus are one of my favourite things to grow -- I've got Valencia orange, blood orange, West Indian lime, mandarin, lemonade -- and just added a yuzu and finger lime to my.collection ( or what I like to refer to as my citrus orchard :P)

The Yuzu doesn't seem too overwhelming. Interested in anyone who grows these and whether you have any first hand pointers? Does a good quality citrus specific soil work?

The finger lime however, I know being a native to our country, will likely thrive on neglect, but not sure how much I should treat this like my others. Should I treat it similar to any of the others I have or is it wildly different and has different soil requirements etc? Again, interested in any first hand advice

The second tree in question is the mini orange tree. It puts off a ton of fruit 2 times a year, but unfortunately the rind is very thick and their is little fruit inside. The fruit that is there is very yummy, but not worth the 1/4""+ thick rind being removed.

The orange tree currently has oranges growing about the size of a pea so I'm hoping to fix the issue before it's to late for this grow!

My garden is currently lawn+patio+privet hedges. ¬†I would like to make it more exciting while promoting biodiversity/encouraging wildlife.

I have the option to move the fence at the back into the scrub-land behind therein extending my garden like neighbours have done. ¬†This would however leave my patio (which is in a state of disrepair) and my shed (which is on a brick plinth,so difficult to relocate) somewhat marooned between my existing green space and any space reclaimed from the scrub-land. ¬†I am not wholly opposed to moving my patio but X2 on the diagram gets the last sun (garden is north-facing), so it is well-suited for seating area. ¬†It Is also not ideal that access to my shed faces out on to the lawn (X3 on diagram)

The garden path, whilst being in the middle is now badly placed as primary access to the garden is not the side door + alley, but via new bi-folding doors (X1 on diagram) I have had put across half of the back of the house (side adjoining to neighbours).

I very much like the idea of an area for growing vegetables, a pond, a some type of rock-garden(s)/use of rocks to create areas of different elevation (garden is currently completely flat).

Also of note is that I have a south facing front garden that is walled off from the road that gets plenty of light. ¬†Could be used for vegetables?

NB: There is currently a drain cover in the lawn about 1.5m in front of X1, but my understanding that this can be relocated.

I‚Äôll start out by saying that many years ago, I grew up on a watermelon farm that would often produce 100+ melons a season. We always grew Charleston grays, and jubilees.

Now trying to get back in the melon business. My question for y‚Äôall is, if I have a 25x15 bed how many hills could I get going in a bed? And about how many melons could I expect from an area that small? Is it feasible to expect at least 50 melons in an area that small? Assuming each vine grows 2-4 melons?

idk if this is the right sub but

my school does a science project every year. All the materials are usually at school, but due to Coronavirus we are now doing the project at home. I was going to do how algae was affected by different salinities of water but since I don't have algae at home I decided to switch it to something that I had in my fridge, which was celery. Now, I'm only growing this for a project, so it will take about 2-3 weeks at maximum. Do I have to buy potting soil for this? Or can I just get by via just putting the celery roots in water?

So to catch/make use of this splashing water I was thinking of having some plant (in a planter) in the spray zone. It wouldn't be directly in the pond, just sitting on the edge so it's not quite bog plant territory.

fyj2a3,gardening,lots of slugs lots of worms; less slugs less worms?,"Hey, gardening friends. I'm a no-till gardener in the PNW, and over our (relatively mild) winter we sheet mulched and grew a bumper crop of big, fat, juicy earthworms and of course, slugs.  We manage slugs mostly by picking (I leave pieces of firewood in the garden that provide daytime shelter, and then clear them of slugs once a day)(and normally, when I lift a piece of firewood, there's a thriving little ecosystem under there of bugs and worms and slugs).

Last year I lost a ton of spring crop to the slugs by not using controls other than picking. A neighbor gardener friend recommended early season control more aggressively to keep the overall population from exploding, so early this spring, when I noticed an uptick in plant damage, I tried applying Sluggo once a week in some areas of the garden that are hardest hit (have made maybe 3 applications in 3 weeks).  

There has been less plant damage, but yesterday when I did my daily slug hunt, I noticed: in areas where the slug population wasn't affected by the sluggo, each log has that awesome buggy ecosystem under it. In areas where the slug population was controlled (no or few slugs under the logs, where previously there were lots) there are also no or fewer earthworms.

I searched around and read up and Sluggo is supposed to be safe for earthworms, but there are some discussions around about it affecting earthworm health. 

Has anyone else (anecdotally) noticed the same? Or, do slugs and worms make good ""companions,"" so if I cut back the slug population (through any means; e.g. just by picking) the worms move along to other pastures too?

We worked so hard to restore the worm wildlife in the garden, so just in case I'm shelving the sluggo and will spend a week or two observing without disturbing anything ... but was just curious if anyone else has noticed a relationship between their worm and slug life.",2,/r/gardening/comments/fyj2a3/lots_of_slugs_lots_of_worms_less_slugs_less_worms/

fyrvjz,gardening,Advice on installing fence posts,"I'm totally new to this.

I'm moving some old posts, and now they are out I need to put them in again in their new spot!

I've done some reading and helpful guides talk about using a post hole digger to create a nice deep hole, then add about 6 inches of aggregate followed by the post (which is to go into the aggregate by about 2 inches), level it up, then pour in concrete.

I'll be doing this work on my own, and levelling up the post and shovelling in cement simultaneously sounds like an accident waiting to happen.

Amazon have just recommended some drive-in clamping fence posts to me, which seem to do away with the need to dig at all. Naturally I don't get to put concrete in, which could be a big downside for me, but otherwise this sounds like a great option as they supposedly keep moisture away from the post itself. As I will be growing veg near to the posts and I can't be sure what chemicals were used when they were pressure-treated, keeping as little contact between post and soil is a key goal.

fzvppy,gardening,Raspberry help! 5a NH,"Hello fellow gardeners! I am in need of help with my raspberry plants. Mostly, identifying them.

I moved into my house a few years ago and there was an old garden. I have been working to clear it out and put in beds. There are some raspberries I have honestly been ignoring for the most part and picking them as I see them, but they are in the part of the garden I haven't been up keeping, so they got over grown.

This year is the year of raspberries. I cleared out the whole garden this time, and cleaned up around the raspberry plants. 

We also have them growing around the perimeter of the property and some mixed in with some lilacs. I leave these for the birds and other wildlife. 

I know I have red, black, and yellow raspberries. Everything I've been reading online says pruning depends on the type of plant. But I'm not sure which plant is which or even which ones had berries last year. 

Questions I need help with:
1. How do I know which canes had fruit last year?
2. If they did have fruit, do I cut/prune them down to the ground? Will they ever produce fruit again?
3. Is it possible to tell what type of plant it is by the cane? Are the black raspberries the ones with the purple-ish canes?
4. Should I just cut them all down and see what happens this year? I want to have raspberries and I am afraid this will cause no berries this year, and could mess up next year too.
5. I want to transplant them so I can grow corn, is it silly to try to grow corn where raspberries were previously?

g0d7ku,gardening,Hello! May I ask you a few suggestions?,"First of all, thank you so much for reading this! Sorry for the possible mistakes, but English is not my first language. 

So, I recently moved to a new apartment in a new city. I have never done any gardening nor have a clue about where to start from, but I have a balcony and would love to have some little plants there. My balcony is small, so it would be ideal for me to use those vases that you can hang on the balcony railing. I did a bit of research and found out that I'd really enjoy plants such as rosemary, sage, peppermint,  Jalape√±o, and chives. I found all of them on the website of a seller from my country who could ship them. The one point I don't understand is how much space do they require. 

To give you an example, I found this  [https://www.amazon.it/Bama-Fioriera-Rondine-balcone-Terracotta/dp/B00AX8H1NS/ref=sr\_1\_1?\_\_mk\_it\_IT=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=fioriere+da+balcone+terracotta&amp;qid=1586756468&amp;s=garden&amp;sr=1-1](https://www.amazon.it/Bama-Fioriera-Rondine-balcone-Terracotta/dp/B00AX8H1NS/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_it_IT=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=fioriere+da+balcone+terracotta&amp;qid=1586756468&amp;s=garden&amp;sr=1-1)  (sorry, I know it's in Italian, but just to provide a little example). I think it's the most classical one. But would it be okay for the plants I mentioned as for dimensions? And how many in each vase? One for each? I tried to look on the internet but I only found that it's okay to grow them in a vase, but nothing precisely about how big that vase has to be! 

Also, my balcony is exposed to direct sunlight from about 8 AM to 2 PM; in winter it does not get really cold (it's less and less frequent to go below 32 degrees) but in July and August we often have about 95 degrees. It's not really windy usually. So, another thing that I don't know is if the mentioned plants could live in this climate; for example, I read somewhere that chives prefer lower temperatures but on another website, I read that it would probably be okay.

So well, I'm REALLY confused and could little use a bit of help. I always see your beautiful gardens and balconies and I'd love to have a little something, too.

Thank you so much for your help!",2,/r/gardening/comments/g0d7ku/hello_may_i_ask_you_a_few_suggestions/

Do I discard these or will they flower again if I divide them (once the others have died down) and replant?  How do I know which of the rhizomes to discard and which to keep.

g0l2t9,gardening,Container Gardening Soil Question,"Hello!

  


I am starting my first container garden on my balcony this spring / summer and am looking to grow some tomatoes (in 20 gallon containers / grow bags), peppers, and a variety of herbs.

  


I am in zone 7a.

  


I am trying to find a good potting soil blend, but the the stores around me pretty much only carry Miracle Gro or Kellogg's. Foxfarms products seem to be nearly impossible or expensive to ship to me at this time.

I reached out to a landscaping business near by and they are selling this:

Landscape Mix - which contains pine fines(soil conditioner), sand (for drainage), a leaf and mushroom compost, and topsoil mixed in.

  


Would that be a good option for containers? I'd like to avoid going with MG if I can. I have the Foxfarms fertilizer trio for supplemental fertilization.

g0xh9w,gardening,How to protect from sudden cold fronts and frost,"TLDR at bottom, because I gave my plants a backstory, because what else are you to do while you wait for your seeds to germinate. 


So, I got some transplant plants, they'd just got their true leaves (I bought them from my schools plant sale, who have amazing teachers, and even work with the county horticulture program), and the teacher working gave us like 12 for free and said ""They're so little, they may not last, good luck""

So I did what ever average Joe does, and stuck em straight out into my garden bed. It gets it's fair share of sun and shade, so if the plants are full sun they spend a little over half the day in sun, and more shady plants also get some shade, it usually works out. 

Well recently we had some hot weather roll around (were talking an over night jump from 60's to 80's) 
But of course, the greenhouse sells good hearty plants, so they lived through that and seemed unaffected. They got a bit sunburned, but not too badly, they can recover. 

Until, of course we get to this one night, and it down pours all night and morning. So I did what everyone does, I watered them that afternoon! (Just kidding! What kinda monster would I be?) I waited a few days (3-4) to water again until the soil tested dry (I use a skewer, if it comes out damp, I don't water). And I had one death, it was a runt, not as small as another one, which is currently working on trying to die, but I won't let him.

TLDR TLDR TLDR TLDR

Anyways, to get to the point here TLDR, tonight the temperatures are supposed to drop from the low 50s  mid 40s, to below freezing, low 30s to low 40s. To protect from getting too cold, I covered them with plastic grocery bags that I cut up and folded over. I then put molch all around the edges to seal it in.

Try a worm bin!,"I tried composting in my back yard, but as I didn't want to spend $$$ for a bin on a stand and I don't have the tools (or know how) needed to build one, every time I tried to compost, I just ended up with a giant exceedingly smelly cockroach farm.  BLECCH!

Then I heard about earthworm bins (AKA Vermiculture).  [This website is a good place to get started.](http://working-worms.com/)

I've been doing it about 2 years now, and the worm castings have been a huge boon to my garden.

Because I lacked some of the tools needed to DIY,  I opted to buy a pre-made ""worm hut"" online for about $100, bought a pound of worms, and gave it ago.  I love it.  There is no stink and it attracts no bugs.  The only odor comes when you open it to add in more food, and it is that wonderful smell that comes from good, rich soil.

I use coconut coir as a base, and add a little fine beach sand or ground oyster shell for grit.  Keep the worms moist, but not wet.  Any lid should be snug, but the system should not be airtight -- they need to breathe.  The worm bin should be in a quiet corner of your house that gets no direct sun.  Mine is in a corner of the kitchen by the pantry.

I leave the top tray empty except for a thick layer of dry straw or shredded paper -- this prevents gnats from setting up shop.

Each tray has a 3-4 month life cycle.  When you are starting, you're going to have to wait 3 months+ for your first crop of ""black gold"", but that's okay. (Also, the black gold does not go bad -- for those of you who live in places with long winters -- it stores in the tray just fine and you can deploy it right away come Spring.)  You prep the new ""active"" tray with your base, set it atop the current ""active tray"", start adding food to it, and stop feeding the other trays.  Give the worms about 2-3 weeks to migrate up.  (I'm now at the point when I give it a month.) The goal is to get a multi tray system going.  I currently have 4 trays in various states (just started a new active tray this morning), plus the 5th one with straw in it.

Do not add meat, dairy, citrus, hot peppers, onion/garlic, or bread (it gets moldy!).  Eggplant, bell pepper, potato peel and tomatoes only occasionally. Other than that, I use my green leafy scraps, banana peels, apple cores, squash and melon rinds, and carrot peels. Worms LOVE coffee grounds and tea leaves (not herbal tea).  I keep a small plastic bin in my fridge (6 inches across, 2.5 inches deep) and every two weeks I add its contents plus my coffee/tea grounds (I keep a bin with a lid just or this) to the active bin.  

Good luck, and your garden (even if it's just a few pots on your balcony or porch) will thank you.",2,/r/gardening/comments/g1a57m/cant_compost_but_want_to_do_something_with_your/

Whelp, got nothing but time and no vacations planned, so I'm excited to get back into this. Started pulling out the supplies and seeds do do the starters tomorrow, and found this stuff in a bucket. 95% sure it is fertilizer. The question I have is, is it for shrubberies and landscaping or for garden veggies? Does it matter?

Just joined this sub and there looks to be a lot of good info in here. Thanks in advance for your help.

Anyways, heres my question; Can mealworm castings go bad?

context: 1-3 years ago I used to own alot of mealworms, but I wasnt into plants yet. I put them in a closed, empty Reptile d3+ calcium as I collected it over time. They have been sitting in a room temp closet, unopenned since.

Does this stuff expire? Would it be ok for me to still make a fertilizing tea from it to water my plants? (specifically, is it safe for me to use on plants I intend to consume the fruit from?) And if its ok in general to use few year old castings?

I just opened it today to check on it; no visible mold, discolouration, and... yep, still smells like mealworm poop.

Will provide pics if needed! Please let me know if this should be fine, I would cry if I killed my prized seedlings and cactuses with it! I also don't want it to go to waste, its a significant amount and I know its not cheap!

We just moved house and now have a nice little garden with some planter/containers surrounding the lawn. We have a small south facing garden.
The planters are currently filled with soil and bark.

Anyway, I have bought a potted Victoria plum tree today (couriered, not bought in person), which is about 1m tall. I‚Äôve sat it on our patio in full sun. It‚Äôs sitting in moist soil right now in a pot about 30cm wide.

I‚Äôd love some tips on what exactly to do with it; I have googled and done some research but would love some one to one advice here if anyone would like to help! I know they like full sun, but the space in our planter that‚Äôs suitable is quite close to the other tree.

Im not much of a green thumb but i give it ago, I have an olive tree that now seems to have black olives, they are very small. from another websites, it looks like they should start green, and grow (and then i guess turn black) So my questions is, are they ripe to eat because they are black? or do some breads start back and grow to size before ready to eat? No sure how old it is, it was there when we moved in 2 years ago, and it looks like someone chopped it down and its now growing from the stump

I *think* my Tiny Tim tomato seedlings are ready to be transplanted (some are starting to grow their second set of what I believe are ""true leaves""), but I'm not sure how best to go about that. So I have some questions, and would love your advice:

1. They are currently in 2"" round seedling pots. Should I transplant them to a medium sized container first (such as a 3x3"" square plastic seedling tray or a used yogurt container with holes in the bottom)? Or can they go directly into the large container they will be living in permanently?

2. How many seedlings should I plant in one pot? I have at least 20 seedlings so that's a lot of pots if it's 1x per pot. (I probably started too many seeds, but I'm new, so ü§∑. More tomatoes for all!)

The leaves are browning and have started to drop at an increasing rate.

We've bought a moisture meter to keep track of the moisture and it seems to be fine. We've even changed the soil one time, added more ""clay balls"" for drainage and checked the roots for rot. Everything seems fine.

Since we live in a sun deprived area we've added a LED light that we keep on 8-10 hrs per day.

It stands in a corner near a window, no drafts and with pretty low light exposure. Temperature is around 22 degrees celcius. No insects in the soil found either and we try to dust off the leaves regularly.

We're out of ideas! What can we do!?

I bought a house in northern canada (Zone 2b) in the winter. I have about 40ft x 50ft of backyard lawn to use as i wish. My first idea was to plant something.

I'm not sure what my soil look like right now, as most of it is still covered in 1-2 ft of snow. It might be great as i live about 400 ft away from a big river.

For a more long time plan, I want to build a green house to grow tomatoes and peppers. But i dont think im going to be planting anything in it this year.

So with the summer starting, and the lockdown going on, I wanted to use my time to get into a new passion of mine: smart gardening. I love the blend of homestead independence, and programming (got solid work experience in the latter, none in the former). 

Does anyone here have any good pointers on resources to get started on this topic? (Not looking for regular home gardening books, but rather resources that already address the digitalized version of it). 

I have found plenty of disparate articles here and there, but was wondering if there was a comprehensive book to get me started.

g3g1tt,gardening,Soil doubts,"I'll cut right to the chase: my yard is not sandy soil. It IS sand. Just sand all over. I'm in Uruguay and prices for anything garden related are high. I've thus decided to make a few raised beds and want to fill them with some fertile soil without paying the incredibly steep prices for the garden-oriented products.


I have a bit of dirt from a previous, small raised bed where I planted tomatoes (kept mulching through the process and left the roots in there to decompose), and probably less from scavenging from several different places (pine forests rich in fungi, old piles of leaves which decomposed into black dirt, etc.). I am afraid it's not going to fill half of one single raised bed.

I can buy peat (it is sold fresh here for gardening purposes, not dried or anything), and construction sand (very thin, small particles. Also available from my own yard but I'd rather not dig into it if I don't have anything to fill it with). It's still a bit of an investment and will probably take me another month to get. Other than that I have a pretty big compost heap I began in February/March, where I have been managing to add vegetable scraps from a nearby store, though it is only about 30-40kg/week at most. I also have access to free sawdust from a local lumber mill.

I just want to know if mixing the peat and sand could yield a good result or be a recipe for disaster. I've used peat alone before and it only compacts as if it were clay. Not sure if the fine sand would do it any good. Also if anyone has any suggestions I might want to look into.

I feel bombarded with information about the ""perfect soil"" and it always involves expensive products like perlite and ""amendments"" (fertilizers) which they can buy by the truckload, but I can't.

g46soz,gardening,Help with my struggling peach/ nectarine trees please!,"Hi guys, I'm based in the UK zone 8b. I'm pretty new to gardening but have a small collection of dwarf/ semi dwarf fruit trees I bought last autumn. Most are doing really well, however my peach (Red Haven) and nectarine (Lord Napier) trees seem to be struggling. I picked these as I thought they were the most suited to the UK climate and had some level of disease resistance compared to other peach/ nectarines.

We didn't have a particularly hard winter but there was a period early in the year where I was not home to cover them as I moved away and it did get quite cold. I sprayed them with copper sulphide + lime mixture in February to treat peach leaf curl, and I thought (hoped) that should also protect against other fungal and bacterial infections.

They're coming into their first season of growth under my care but many of their branches have no growth on them and seem dead. Neither of them blossomed. Additionally the peach tree is oozing sap at the graft area. Is this bacterial canker?

My wife and I moved into our first house about a year and a half ago in Hamilton, Ontario (southern Ontario), we have a dog (Shiba Inu) who loves to run in the backyard and does a little digging. We have a couple of trees on the property, all seem to be experiencing some sort of issue. I hope I have identified them properly, and could really use some help to ensure they don't die...if they are in fact dying. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Row of Red Cedars -  https://imgur.com/LK7p3Zk   and  https://imgur.com/Sy1t4WC '

They seem to be very thin in the middle and the bottom. I began cutting away the dead growth on the bottom a month ago. I found that there were some vines growing up and all through the trees. It was a scary amount of vines and was likely damaging the trees. To give you an idea, I removed 15-yard waste bags of stuff, probably 3 or 4 of them were just the vines. The base of the vines was about 1.5 inches thick. I have been trying to find a guide on how to trim these (if they are red cedars). Can I expect these to fill out in the middle again? Should there be anything else I am doing to help this happen? If they are doomed, I am prepared to remove them and put in a wood fence like the rest of my yard. This is the only side of the yard with a chain-link fence. 

2. Northern Catalpa Tree - 

Two images from last summer. We had to cut it back to protect the garage and the house. (Now I know we did not follow proper cutting guidelines).

 https://imgur.com/ZxuBygJ 

The bark is flaking off from the tree, and it appears that it has been since I moved in. I tried to google this and can't find any real information on it. You can see there is a lot of growth coming in on the limbs where cuts were made. I am concerned that the tree is not doing well only because of the bark issue. The tree seems to bloom very well and has dropped lots of beans in the past two years. I would love to keep this tree from dying. If it is going to go in the next few years I would like to be prepared to add something else for privacy. 

3. Side Tree -  https://imgur.com/e35yzc8   https://imgur.com/27hvDkz    https://imgur.com/RuALP1S (tree to the right of the gazebo) 

I love this tree. I think it is really nice and would like to keep it. As you can see the trunk of the tree has a bit of a hole in it. The wood of the tree is rather brittle and breaks away easily. Not sure if this is part of the growing process as only the outer leaves/buds would get enough sunlight to grow. How can I fix this or know if it is causing issues? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your help. I was hoping to take these photos to a garden centre for assistance but with the COVID situation that is not an option in Ontario.

g4u6l2,gardening,Question on preparing in-ground beds for this growing season,"I'm looking for advice on starting an in ground garden in my yard. I live in Central Wisconsin, zone 4a. 

I have a few 4x4 raised garden beds, but would like to be able to plant more this year. Though the raised beds yielded great results for us last year, they are cost prohobitive currently.

We have silty soil but still managed to be able to grow cabbage and pumpkins in the ground last year without any real amendments and decent result. This gives me hope that I can still grow more this year without spending  a lot on raised beds.

I have a couple large piles of compost that can be spread over the planting sites and worked into the soil as well as dead leaves that can be used as mulch.

My question is a matter of working up the compacted soil. These beds used to be lawn and we just finished removing the sod. The ground is compacted, but not hard like cement either. There a few small rocks here and there, but nothing too horrible from what we've seen. 

I would eventually like to do a no-till garden in these spots, but I don't know if it would be ready in time for this planting season. Should I rent a tiller and till up the soil in the meantime? Or would it be better to use a spading fork or broadfork so I don't disturb the soil structure any more than necessary? Or should I just throw the compost and mulch on top and hope for the best?

g4uzh6,gardening,Something's eating my peppers...any ideas?,"I have a number of potted veggies growing in a greenhouse. Over the past few days, my sweet banana pepper and New Mexico chile pepper have lost a number of leaves, and have also had leaves half-eaten. You can see in the album below my sweet banana pepper. The first shot is yesterday; there's a half-eaten leaf on the plant. The second shot is this morning; something pulled a leaf off the plant and it's now half-eaten on the dirt. The New Mexico chile has similar damage, though a bell pepper that's growing in a pot between the chile and the banana pepper looks untouched. Jalapeno and habanero that are growing on the other side of the greenhouse appear to be unaffected as well.

Unfortunately, I'm afraid that too much damage may have been done to the banana pepper, and maybe the chile as well, but I'm interested in your thoughts on a few questions:

1) Is this banana pepper salvageable? Special care to help it come back to thrive? 

2) What might be the cause of this? I looked for caterpillars/hornworm a number of times throughout yesterday, including well after dark, and again this morning, but haven't seen anything.

3) The natural follow-up to 2), what can I do to stop whatever is feeding on my plants? I'd prefer to start ""natural"" but am not strictly opposed to engaging in chemical warfare if that will give me the best shot here.

I thought it was some kind of disease, so I trimmed the entire plant down to a few centimeters to let it start over. New leaves are appearing, but they don't seem to smell of anything either. Or maybe I should just give it some time (and neglect? Someone told me herbs shouldn't be pampered)",2,/r/gardening/comments/g4vsgz/melissa_officinalis_lemon_balm/

g5298i,gardening,Balcony Garden Help,"Hi there,

My gf and I have recently decided to get a small herb garden going on our balcony. Right now we have the plants indoors in smaller pots, but I'm actually building a larger planter to go out on the balcony when the temperature gets a little warmer and when they get a bit bigger.

The balcony gets about 6 to 8 hours of sunlight every day, which I'm unsure if that's enough, especially because the planter will sit right next to a guard rail, which will shade the plants a bit (albeit slightly).

Worried about this, I've thought about getting some LED lamps to put out there to supplement some additional light for the plants. It looks like there's some affordable ones out there (see [here](https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Waterproof-Greenhouse-Indoor-Gardening/dp/B07MQ2PLSR/) and [here](https://www.amazon.com/Spectrum-Warmwhite-Growing-Hydroponics-Indoor/dp/B07SSWM42N)), but none of them look like they're really *outdoor* proof. Waterproof from hand-watering sure, but being able to handle outdoor weather? I'm not sure. Our balcony has a roof up above, but there's no protection on an entire side, so the plants and any hardware would be partially exposed to all the elements.

So this is where I would appreciate the help from more experienced hands. What I want to know is:

1. Given my setup, is it worth pursuing LED grow lights to help my herbs grow?
2. If it is worth it, do you know of any setup/products out there that are truly outdoor safe?",2,/r/gardening/comments/g5298i/balcony_garden_help/

I had been giving them 1-2‚Äù of water a week. I noticed last week they were starting turn brown on the south side of the plant and the north side was still green. I have a few left over in pots  that were laying on the ground near the house and they are still green

In week 1 the temps were lows mid 30s and highs in the 50s week 2 and 3 it‚Äôs been consistently in the 30s all day and windy! Regular gusts of &gt;30mph and relatively sunny.  

Looks to be warming up now no longer reaching freezing temps with lows in the upper 30s....

I‚Äôm wondering if I need to do anything different or if I‚Äôm at risk of losing some of these. The soil seems to have some clay and remains moist. From what I read the browning is from drying out but the soil is fairly moist, should I start thinking about protecting them from the wind or will warmer temps coming help prevent the drying and allow them to recover? Will they recover? I don‚Äôt want to try and wrap/protect 60 trees if I don‚Äôt have to. Any advice would be helpful and appreciated. Thanks!

g5no6g,gardening,Quick Gardening Noob question?,"Hi there! So a couple months back I bought a sage, rosemary, and thyme plant. I planted them in a large planter with organic soil from the store. I fertilize them here and there with an organic fertilizer.

The plants themselves are super happy, very green, growing nicely, and full. Smell good and make delicious seasoning!

However, when I water them, if I look closely: there‚Äôs definitely some bugs in the soil. I won‚Äôt lie, this is taking me some getting used to as I don‚Äôt often come into contact with unknown bugs. I‚Äôm used to spiders and cockroaches but that‚Äôs about it lol

Is it normal to have bugs in the soil, as long as the plants are growing and happy? I noticed the main ones I found were small millipedes or maybe centipedes? With some red color to them. Pretty small in size. Then the occasional random small fly bug type but that idk what it is.

I just don‚Äôt want to overthink it. I imagine it‚Äôs from the organic soil? I live on the second floor, plants are outside on balcony, so not sure how all the bugs happened unless they were already in the soil when I bought it. I don‚Äôt care as long as the plants are okay, which so far they are happy.

g5orpg,gardening,Worried about drainage with ‚Äúself irrigated‚Äù planter I built,"[https://imgur.com/gallery/4hpG7zF](https://imgur.com/gallery/4hpG7zF)

Hey friends, I recently constructed my first planter on my deck in hope to put a few herbs and veggies in it soon. I started off just wanting a simple box, but as I thought about how I wanted to build it, I started looking into articles that used self irrigation techniques. I made the box, then started drilling holes into the pvc system pictured. I had found multiple articles who used this system, but on a bit of a larger scale with corrugated perforated pipe instead of pvc. 

The idea is that I stick the hose into the upright pvc pipe and it fills the two routes of pvc with water, then spews out the holes drilled on top and absorbs up into the soil (I wrapped the pvc in landscaping fabric to prevent soil from clogging the holes).

Of course I knew I needed a drain, so I made one with more pvc and drilled into the side of my box and put some fabric over it. 

So now I‚Äôm wondering a few things:
-Did I put my drain too high up? I don‚Äôt want water sitting in the bottom and rotting the soil. Once the plants are planted in there I assume it will absorb more water through the roots, but still I feel like the soil will just rot away with that much water. I would be okay with making another drain lower down if it‚Äôs needed. 
-Does anybody have experience with this type of homemade irrigation system? I‚Äôd love tips if there‚Äôs anything I should know about or add to improve the quality of my garden box.

Thanks in advance!",2,/r/gardening/comments/g5orpg/worried_about_drainage_with_self_irrigated/

g5qbaq,gardening,Climbing plant questions.,"Hello,

I've recently been trying to grow some vines, but I don't think I get them. I tried growing some crossvine (*Bignonia capreolata*) on plastic lattice, but it would not wrap around it. Instead, it climbed up the walls of my house. Someone on reddit told me that vines generally don't like plastic to climb on.

I now have some butternut squash seedlings and passion fruit seeds, and I don't want to mess up again, so I have some questions.

1. I have a pergola supported by 6x6 posts, is that too thick for vines to wrap around? I can make a trellis if it makes it easier for them to climb, but the less work I have to do the better
2. Would it be easier for them to climb if the wood was unsanded and rough?
3. Do they ever get to a point where they will eventually be able to climb the post, or should I make the trellis as tall as the pergola, so it can reach the canopy? 
4. Is it okay to grow different plants in the same trellis/pergola? I was hoping I'd be able to save space. Will they choke each other out though? Is that even possible?",2,/r/gardening/comments/g5qbaq/climbing_plant_questions/

g5qq2d,gardening,Started too many seeds in one tray. Help,"Hi. I started some seeds a few days ago indoors and they're growing great, but I realize that I placed way too many seeds per spot. I'm not sure what to do. 

Do I wait for them to grownbigger then try to seperate them? 

Should I seperate them now while they're still small?

Should I just keep them together?

The seeds ive started are 
Brocolli 
Cauliflower 
Lettuce
Radishes
Spinach
Carrots

I think I planted too many for each one. I basically pinched a bunch of seeds between my fingers and sprinkled them in. So there could be as much as 12 seeds per spot.

I don't know if this is necessary information, but I plan on growing all of these in containers. I live with my sister and cannot kill her grass as I grow these.

g5s5es,gardening,"Fresh wood chips as mulch, plus dyeing","Excuse the long post, I want to provide some context.

We moved into a house on a 2 acre lot almost completed surrounded by woods, so there is tons of branch/wood debris. The neighborhood is split about 50/50 between households employing a service for their cleanups, and others doing it themselves.  I'm doing it myself. The prior owners used a service, and in the woods are several large piles of branches/twigs presumably representing the last X years of cleanups and dump sites.  This year after some storms and starting the spring clean on my own, I quickly accumulated 5 wheelbarrow loads of branches/twigs and started to make a new pile.  The piles are quite visible, and clearly will take years to disintegrate, so I invested in a chipper/shredder, and have decided to destroy the material myself, and hopefully put it to some use.  

The property is beautifully landscaped with lots of shrubs and perennials, but most of the garden beds seem a bit eroded, and the mulch is clearly thinning out and needs refreshed.  After the chipper arrived I was able to produce 3-4 wheelbarrows of nice fine wood chips, and barely scratched the surface of branches on the property.  I spread out what I produced at the end of one of the beds and I'm pleased with the chip quality, however being without dye they are too light in color and the garden will look much better with the dark color the base mulch had (see picture).  

My questions are:

To what extent might the chips darken on their own?  And to some estimate, over what time period? For reference, I am in NE Ohio.  

I have purchased some EnviroColor black mulch dye, and was planning on spraying the chips, letting them dry, then mixing/agitating to reveal the non-dyed portions, and spraying them again.  While this may not result in uniformly jet black mulch like a dyed product I could purchase, might I have some success in at least darkening the chips, to some extent similar to color to the base much near the edges of the chips in the picture?

Thank you for your help.

g68rc3,gardening,First time growing garlic(or anything) can I leave it in the plantar box?,"Hi everyone. Last October I planted 12 garlic cloves in a plantar box thing because I knew we would be moving in the spring and would need to take it with us(we just moved into our new house a couple of weeks ago, yay). 


My question is do you think this is way too small for the garlic to fully grow in? My new house does have plantar beds and I guess we could move the garlic over into those although I would be afraid I'd screw up what I already have as it looks pretty awesome so far!


Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.

g6cku7,gardening,Losing battle against Oxalis Stricta plant/weed. Any tips for groundcover?,"I'm trying to grow and maintain some groundcover in my backyard, but it seems like this Oxalis Stricta plant/weed is slowly taking over. I was hoping the Dymondia and Lemon Thyme that I have were robust enough to crowd out the Oxalis for their specific areas, but I'm not so sure anymore. I've been fighting the good fight by hand picking, but that's proving to be too time-consuming.

Should I (1) embrace this Oxalis plant as a groundcover intertwined with the other plants, (2) dig up the groundcover and opt for some weed barrier and rocks instead, (3) try something else?

The following link has some input on the manner (Managing Oxalis weed in Dymondia), but I'm wondering if anyone else has some tips? Supposedly this Pendulum 2G herbicide is a re-emergent herbicide safe for Dymondia...but it's only available in bulk and is expensive :(

g6lsth,gardening,Why are my tomato plants shriveling?,"http://imgur.com/a/mtoFTgu

I've been gardening for almost a year now, and I started these tomato plants on March 14th after doing a ton of research. They were growing so incredibly well that I was kind of shocked actually, and then once they got their 4-5th(ish) set of leaves, they started to shrivel and wilt, crumple, and dry out as you can see in the photo (with good leaves still below). It's gotten so bad that some of the good ones have started to shrivel as well. I read that tomato leaves curl when they are overwatered, so initially I tried giving them less water, but that has not seemed to help. Since then I've tried just about everything... I've tried:
- giving them more space 
- giving them less/more light
- repotting them 
- taking them outside in the sun
- moving them to a different room
- pruning off the dead branches (hence why you can't see the 4-5 good ones) 
- giving them the same ratio of water as I did in the beginning when they were growing well
- talking nicely to them....

Everything! My last ditch attempt at reviving them right now has been to put them on a heat mat back in their original room. Does anyone have any idea what these leaves mean? I really don't know where I went wrong... They were doing so so so incredibly well, and the specialty seeds are hard to come by during the pandemic.",2,/r/gardening/comments/g6lsth/why_are_my_tomato_plants_shriveling/

They have/had TONS of daffodils that line both fences that the entire neighborhood loves. Money plant also grows in the flower beds and I have many fond memories of playing with the seed pods. Yesterday, I got permission to go dig up some bulbs and plants for transplanting. I‚Äôve got daffodil bulbs collected to plant in the fall, money plant in a pot, and some wisteria cuttings. Apparently, the wisteria originally came from my grandpa‚Äôs sister‚Äôs house and the money plant originally came from his brother‚Äôs house. I‚Äôm excited to keep their memories alive (and blooming)!",2,/r/gardening/comments/g6z26q/the_joys_of_transplanting/

Anyone know what might be causing it to lose its needles on the lower branches near the trunk? The only remaining needles are on the ends of the branches and near the top of the tree.

Can the tree be saved or should it be removed? Can whatever disease it has spread to other trees of the same or different type?

Thanks so much!

The bottom of container is permeable so when it rains, it drains through.

The compost is eggshells and fruit rinds that I put in the food processor until they were very small. Ideally I would have done this before I planted anything but planning isn‚Äôt my forte.

In some spots the white goo is a thin layer. In other parts it‚Äôs an actual chunk of goo (visible in the rock pics) that I can easily scoop up with a rock (I‚Äôve been careful not to touch this with my fingers). 

Would anyone take a look and possibly be able to tell me if this is mold? Eggshell protein? Is it from the compost? How should I approach it? Thank you.

g7x8ck,gardening,Raised Bed vs Container,"Hey reddit gardeners, long time lurker. 

Our duplex has a shared raised bed that our neighbor decided she wants to use half of this year, not a huge issue, but raised (bad pun absolutely intended) some questions. 

Our raised bed area is about 4' x 4', gets good full sun and we water with a hose, we plan to get some containers as well, but the question is, which plants would benefit most from being in the bed vs being in the containers? 

In an ideal world, here's what we're trying to plant, we're in the saint louis area, so Zone 6b. 

Tomatoes - Caged

Cucumber - planning to stake and tie the plants off to go vertical

Zucchini - planning to stake and tie to go vertical

Bell Pepper or another sweet type pepper. 

Jalapeno Pepper

Banana Pepper

Pepperoncini

Kale or Broccoli or Brussel sprouts ( these would be our first ever cabbage type, so really need guidance here. )

Various herbs (definitely destined for containers. )

Any Tips?  My thoughts are to put zucchini and cucumber in the ground, containers for everything else, but I'm aware of how little I know and how plants benefit from good raised bed topsoil  vs whatever potting mix we'll have to use for the containers.

Alternatively, the one side of my garden gets pretty good sunlight and has tall fence. I might be able to put the container against the fence and use it as a trellis? The downside of this is my husband will not be impressed with killing his grass under the pot.

Basically the area I want to put the planter box against my house gets pretty swampy after a rain. Standing water etc. I also worry about basement flooding.  Long story short, is it a good idea to put a garden against my house where there is poor drainage? I'm thinking it might be a good idea to help the drainage and use the area for the extra moisture for the garden.

g9rqls,gardening,Video community gardening,"Hey all!  


I'm been tasked with organising a community video gardening session within my area due to lockdown.  


The idea is for me to put together a budget for what the folks would need (ie pots, soil, seeds) then buy it, divide it up, deliver it and have a video call to sow some seeds together and maybe do updates to see how it's going via whatsapp or something like it!  


There's also been an idea to do the same but with printed instructions for those who don't want to join on video.  


We're based in central London, so people will mainly be growing things in window sills and potentially balconies. I think we'd like to start with 10 people as that's a good group size for a video call.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering what you guys think will be good to start with? I'm thinking herbs, lettuce, radishes etc.  


I want things that'll germinate easily so that people don't get frustrated and stick with it!  


Maybe a 'mini kitchen garden' would be nice where there's some lettuce, herbs and radishes together? If so, any thoughts on what can work together in one container?

I dont have much to work with right now. 
      So, now I‚Äôm getting to the part about my neighbor. He lives by himself in a large two story house and his front and back yard are full of weeds and other stuff. I‚Äôve seen him every now and then when i sit on my porch, taking in all sorts of tools and other construction stuff. He knows that I really love plants and he seems like a really nice guy. He always has other people over helping him work on the house. I was just wanting to know if asking him if I could redo his front yard for him would be rude? I love cleaning up peoples gardens for them. Im shy about asking because I wouldn‚Äôt want him to think that i think its an eye sore because I think over grown garden have a nice aesthetic to them.

g9tg1z,gardening,Am I pruning my espalier apple tree correctly?,"I hope this is the right subreddit to post my question. My boyfriend has had this trained espalier apple tree (not sure of variety) for a few years now. It has never bore fruit until last season, where it produced a whopping ONE tiny apple. This year, it looks like there's maybe 4-6 little apple buds, but otherwise nothing else. He has pruned it before, but maybe isn't pruning it correctly.

I've watched tons of videos on pruning fruit trees/espaliers, aware of the DDD/CAC cutting rule. I started pruning it already, but now I'm nervous I've messed up, so I stopped. Have I cut the right branches? WHERE exactly do I cut it (heading or thinning cut? How close? ) because my branches don't look quite like those in the videos I've seen. A lot didn't even look like there were basal leaves (stems are mostly woody, without leaves, until like 6"" out) and no flowering nodes, as far as I can tell. 

Hoping to prune for fruit production. Thanks for any help!

g9u0t1,gardening,Raised bed on wet ground,"So, our back yard slopes downward, and I would love to put a small raised bed garden in. Trouble is, if I put it on the sides of the yard, the garden will be on an angle, and I fear that might screw up the garden (I could level it out, but it would be a royal pain). I could put it in the very back, but our soil is kinda sandy and full of clay, so it likes to retain water for a bit after it rains (no more than 24 hours).  
Question is, what's the lesser of two evils here? Can I plant the garden on the slope and it be okay? Or can I plant it in the back, even though the ground will be more wet (it will be raised though, so maybe it'll be okay)?

My questions are: 

1. How do you properly maintain a plant besides just dumping water on it once and a while? (and how different fertilizers work at different concentrations) What checklist do I need to make sure my plant undergoes each day so it stays happy and healthy?
2. What do you need to know that isn't specified on the back of a Lowes seed packet? Like, how should you keep pests from destroying everything you hold dear without pesticides?
3. I plan on growing these in a structure ideal for the plant. I could make it myself. I got time to kill. Any recommendations on what to make with wood, plastic, metal or the like?

fzw8i9,gardening,New to gardening. What veggies to grow on my balcony?,"Hi everyone!

I am in Zone 6a, and I've got a relatively small balcony that gets a decent amount of light from 7:00am to around 2:00pm. It faces to the East. I'm curious if anyone could give me some recommendations on how I best get started. My goal is to grow some vegetables that I can use to eat. Some vegetables I've researched that might be good: Arugala, Spinach, Cucumber, Green Beans, Green Onions, and Peppers. I also plan to grow some herbs as well.

If anyone could also recommend planters and related tools that would be great. I was thinking of getting some planters that overhang our railings.

Thank you!

Edit: Adding photos of my balcony.

fuwger,gardening,Complete n00b - tips/encouragement?,"Hey y'all. I live in Mississippi and have access to a greenhouse in the backyard, or just the ground. My mom has been severely depressed the last few years, and while this whole COVID thing is going on, I'm helping to take care of her. I'm trying to get her back into things she really enjoyed doing years ago. 

So I figured since we don't know how long this whole COVID thing is going to last, I would grow some tomatoes, squash, etc. while I'm home. I was really stoked about the seeds and soil I bought yesterday, but when I brought it all home, she just looked at me and told me that I'd just wasted a lot of money because it's not the right time of year for that. 

My mama knows a shit ton about plants.. she may as well have a botany degree. But she's also been **absolutely the worst with her negativity** in the last few years, and what she said really bummed me out. The charts on the back of the packages showed that it was doable for our region? 

Did I really fuck up? It was only $30, and I'm willing to put forth a ton of energy into this if it means that we can have tomatoes in a few months. Does anybody have any tips/tricks to make it work? I have access to a small greenhouse and hundreds of pots/equipment because she used to be huge into plants, etc. 

my main questions are:  
* should I start them in the little tiny, plastic flats, or just start them in their own pots?  
* is it possible to grow them completely in pots, or do they need to be in the ground?  
* I would like to do this as organically as possible with no chemicals. do you have any recommendations to keep bugs away without the use of pesticides?

Thanks in advance. &lt;3

fw29ut,gardening,Frustrated. Is there any way to clean/drench out pre-emergent?,"(Important part near the bottom) 

I live in an apartment complex and have my garden set up going for a little over 2 years. Last year the lawn maintenance guy, apartment staff, and I made an agreement where, in my area of the complex, from one building end to the other, it is under my care. This is after their crew repeatedly mangled my pots, weed-eated my flowers, and massacred the shrubs to near death. So they aren't supposed to spray, trim, cut, prune, edge, or weed-eat. I also maintain the community roses. 

Two or three weeks ago, I had my wildflower seedlings growing strong and close to flowering when the next day I find they were all dying, wilting, and over the week all were dead. I wanted to pass it off as a result of too much sun, but today showed differently..

New maintenance staff wasn't told to stay out of this area, hacked up a gardenia and privet that I spent a year rehabilitating. I'm livid. Talked, nicely, to the boss and he profusely apologized, said he would remind his staff.

IMPORTANT PART:
Later, I then saw a guy in another area spraying what I assume was pre-emergent and or herbicide, which rang alarm bells because I had LITERALLY YESTERDAY reseeded my wildflower area with new soil. He was in an area that would come long after he potentially sprayed my area.

g7f00t,gardening,Could use some advice for growing tomatoes and chilis in indoor pots,"I'm currently growing some tomatoes and chilis in some indoor pots (since we don't have a garden). I've tried growing chilis before, but it has never been any big success. If I've been lucky there have been just a few chilis on each plant.

This year I'm giving it another try, and have added cucumbers and tomatoes as well. The progress can seen here:

[https://imgur.com/a/8ZGj4Wi](https://imgur.com/a/8ZGj4Wi)

I really want it to be successful this time, so I hope some of you clever gardeners can help me with some questions :) 

In the first picture, 3 plants are actually growing in the same pot, and in the second picture, 2 plants are growing in the same pot. This is a result of me sowing more than one seed in a pot (I've heard that I should do that, somewhere).

But I think I've also heard that I should remove some of the plants, such that there's only 1 plant in each pot. Is this true? And if so, how do I do it without damaging the plant I want to keep?

Another thing is that I've read that each plant should end up in, at least a 30 cm (12 inches) pot, If you want any chilis. I think this is very large (especially since I have like 19 seedlings at the moment, and also large pots are really expensive). I've read something similar for tomatoes.

Is it possible in any way to grow chilis, tomatoes and cucumbers in smaller pots than 30 cm pots?

If you have any other advice for making this a success, I would greatly appreciate it :)

fzofim,gardening,Essential Oils in Gardening. I'd love some advice.," I read this article on essential oils and its benefits in the garden. I wondered if anyone has tried it? Here is an excerpt from that article.

**Peppermint**

Peppermint oil is widely used because of its strong scent to most humans, and especially to bugs. In the past, peppermint oil has been used for getting rid of rats, as well as deterring other pests like insects. Specifically, peppermint oil will deter ants, aphids, bean beetles, moths, flies, caterpillars and even mice.

**Purification**

Citronella and lemongrass can be added to the peppermint to make oil that is referred to as purification. This mixture can deter insects like ticks, nematodes, fleas, carrot flies, gnats, mosquitoes and more. It also holds some powerful anti-fungal properties and can be used to maintain your garden.

**Oregano and Thieves**

Oregano and Thieves are similar to purification in that they also possess properties that can help fight many different varieties of fungus. These two oils also contain an additional power when it comes to viruses and bacteria. Why is this helpful? Beginning gardeners may not understand that those same problems can come into a garden and have a negative effect on the plants and their growth. They can also attack vegetables and fruits which can cause disease.

**Cedarwood Oil**

One of the lesser known oils is called Cedarwood and it is also helpful in the garden. While snails and slugs may not always cause problems, in large amounts they can be a gardener‚Äôs worst nightmare. Cedarwood oil is great at naturally deterring snails and slugs from your plants.

**Applying the Oil**

There are many different ways that people choose to apply the essential oils into their gardens, and it is usually just a matter of preference. You can make a spray with a mixture of water and essential oils. All you have to do is take the essential oils that you want to use and add four to eight drops into a single gallon of water. Put the liquid into a sprayer and then apply it to your flowers, fruit and vegetable plants and if needed, directly on the fruit and vegetables.

To target specific insects in large numbers, take some cotton balls and add a few drops of the oil to them. This works best with peppermint oil or the purification blend. Next, place the cotton ball right onto the ant hill, burrow or other insect grouping to cause them to relocate immediately. If that doesn‚Äôt work at first, you should repeat this same process.

Yogurt containers are good to keep and recycle as well by burying them in the ground with the rim of the cup even with the dirt level. Simply place a few drops in each cup and the scent from the containers will repel anything you don‚Äôt want to come around. You can also soak strings and place them in the rows of your garden between the different plants.

If you prefer to keep your homemade repellants out of the dirt and away from your plants, you can always soak or spray strips of fabric and hang them from trees or above your garden. These can be easily added to or, if needed, taken away if you feel the scents may be too strong. It is also easy to go out and re-apply any oil if you feel like the effect has worn off.

**Know Your Garden**

The last bit of advice is to just give different oils a try. You may find that one type of oil works better than others in the different areas of your garden. With a little patience and gardening, you will find something natural and non-toxic that suits you and your plants.",14,/r/gardening/comments/fzofim/essential_oils_in_gardening_id_love_some_advice/

They don't seem to have any sort of fungus or mildew and there are no aphids on the plants, which are one of my biggest garden pests here. Any help appreciated...

g793jk,gardening,Poppies? Legal? Need deer resistant plants,"So very long story very short, I have a lot of land (2 acres) and some flowering plants do survive but really only very large ones like my lilacs, or ‚Äúsmelly‚Äù ones like peonies and irises. I have a MAJOR deer problem. A ‚Äúfamily‚Äù of about 25-30 hangs out in my yard literally constantly. They are not afraid of us even. I come out to walk my Pitbull and they just stare us down because they vastly outnumber us. They are here year after year and I am betting their lineage has hung out on my property for hundreds of years due to the fact my land was once an orchard and they seem to have developed a very lazy but smart technique of standing under my remaining fruit trees and waiting for fruit to simply drop at their feet. 
ANYWAY. I am SICK of planting things and everything just getting eaten. I put a 4-5 foot fence AND deer repelling garlic or some kind of smelly powder can‚Äôt remember brand, around a lovingly tended vegetable plot with sunflowers and they hopped inside and ate everything. Same with almost anything I plant. Everything has to have a cage around it. 
Anyway I was looking into flowers that deer will avoid and most of the ones listed just so happen to be what usually comes back undisturbed year after year- iris, daffodil, bleeding heart, peony. 
Some others mentioned were foxglove, poppy and monkshood due to their toxins. 
I‚Äôd like to give as many flowers as possible a try but I worry about legality of planting poppies. Does anyone know if that is a risk I should worry about? I wouldn‚Äôt be planting acres of them or anything. 
In any case I hope to really lean into the irises this year because of their variation and ease of care.",14,/r/gardening/comments/g793jk/poppies_legal_need_deer_resistant_plants/

g8g73k,gardening,"Help me grow chillies, so far its not going well.","This is my 3rd year trying to grow chillies. The first year i over watered them and it went all mouldy. The 2nd year i potted them on too quickly they fell over and died.

This year...its not gone too well. So i first planeted left over chillies I had from last year (bought August 2019), Birdseye, Jalapeno Early and Habanero Red. They all failed to germinate at all.

So i tried again. This time i bought some new chillies as I was worried the seeds were maybe old or something, I dont know. I bought Jalapeno, Orange Habanero, Red Scotch Bonnet and Ring of Fire seeds. What i also did was bought an actual chilli pepper, cut it open and planted the seeds from it.

I've attacheched pictures. The ones with the growing chillies is the cut open chilli pepper I bought. The other 3 tubs are the Ring of Fire, Orange Habanero, Jalapeno and Scotch Bonnet. The long tub has a mix of the two - Jalapeno and Orange Habanero.

The smaller tubs I have kept them in a zip-lock bag to try create like a propagator to make sure it is warm enough to germinate. they have been in there for about two weeks and nothing. I don't know why they havent grown when the one from the chilli pepper I bought out of Tescos has grown under the same conditions. Can anyone help? What am I doing wrong? The chillies sit on my kitchen window ledge, south facing that gets lots of sun. The long tub is in the bathroom south facing as well.

Did you ever get sea monkeys as a kid and expect glorious shrimps wearing crowns living in castles, only to be disappointed that they look like finely ground black pepper in water? That‚Äôs a very specific reference but it‚Äôs totally what I‚Äôm experiencing right now. 

Now, I knew 3‚Äù pots are tiny so I don‚Äôt fault the nursery, however I‚Äôve bought herbs in 3‚Äù pots before [and here is a photo of some lemon thyme at the bottom for comparison, as well as some pulmonaria.](https://ibb.co/vzqFht7)

I know gardening isn‚Äôt instant gratification but this is ridiculous, no?

2. [Look how tiny these 3‚Äù plants are, they‚Äôre basically freshly propagated!](https://ibb.co/1svf0Ty) Should I up-pot them? Stick them directly in the ground? Should I put them in the ground in full sun then move them in a year once they are larger? I am not an experienced enough gardener to know what to do with babies and I thought I was getting more established 3‚Äù ones such as the thyme.

3. Should 3‚Äù pot plants cost less since they are so tiny? Kind of feel like these were not worth the money to be honest, and I hope they grow rapidly. For context, if I had seen these in person I probably wouldn‚Äôt have purchased, but I made a beginner mistake and got seduced by a catalogue. I also totally mixed up 3 gallons with 3‚Äù and thought I was going to get 3 gallon sized plants. üòï I‚Äôve had good experience buying bulbs from catalogues but these plants look so tiny I don‚Äôt know how they will survive?

fxlut2,gardening,First Time Tomato Tips??,"Hey all!

As most of you know, there‚Äôs a little pandemic happening right now and like many, I‚Äôm using quarantine as a detoxification of my lifestyle. After cleaning up my diet and cooking a lot more, my parents and I decided we‚Äôd like to start a garden to provide our most used fruits and veggies! Among our first crops are green beans, green onions, white onions, herbs (sage, rosemary, thyme), and seemingly the scariest...tomatoes.

I‚Äôve been drowning in gardening tips videos about tomatoes and my biggest fear is growing three plants and having one of the plethora of bad possibilities happen and kill off any yield (bloom end rot, tomato worms, etc). 

What are the essentials I need to do (staking, pruning...), what are good-to-haves, and what should I be less worried about despite what these videos have been telling me?",13,/r/gardening/comments/fxlut2/first_time_tomato_tips/

fxtsfy,gardening,Do I need help...to remove a tree stump?,"I'm currently using the lockdown to blitz the garden of my new house - ([pictures if anyone's interested](https://ibb.co/album/iJw6wF)). At the bottom is a huge mound of soil/rubble/glass/sycamore tree stump which we are in the process removing, however, the final part of the stump and root system is proving tricky. I have used a reciprocating saw to cut through quite a few of the roots however anything greater than 20cm diameter is impossible.

My options appear to be:

1. Hiring a bloke/blokess with a stump grinder.
2. Renting something heavy duty to remove it myself.
3. Thermite

Each option has its pros and cons so any and all help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

g5zqsa,gardening,Best practice with regards to water storage,"Hi people

We had a ridiculously dry summer 2 years ago in the UK, with reservoirs running low and a ban on hosepipe usage. This prompted me to get a couple of rainwater storage tanks to syphon off water from gutters. They work well.

Now we are going through a bit of a dry spell, which probably will end soon, but it might not.

At first we used to exclusively use our rainwater storage tanks for all watering, but recently I've been thinking that if we do that, we will deplete our reserves and then when it comes time that perhaps restrictions are in place, we will have less or no water left in the tanks, rendering them useless at a time we would need them.

So I've started using mains water again and then if and when the need arises, I've got these 3 big tanks of water to use.

It still seems a bit wasteful and not ideal.

Is this the best way to do things or are their alternatives?",13,/r/gardening/comments/g5zqsa/best_practice_with_regards_to_water_storage/

To me, ""organic"" soil is any soil containing organic matter, but I have a feeling they're talking about organic as in the lifestyle. When I ask what they mean they usually tell me something along the lines of ""I don't want there to be any chemicals in it"". This raises a lot of questions for me but I dont want to be off-putting to a customer so I dont usually dig deeper than that. Can someone please give me some information about what ""chemicals"" they're concerned with and the effects they have on us? I'd prefer reputable sources and studies, I don't mind doing some reading.

So... I was looking for places to order seeds, and Renees Garden seemed like the right place, is this a good seller?

Not only in terms of shipping and germination, but do they have a good reputation for labeling (I have a weird paranoia that the seeds will be in the wrong package and I will end up with something harmful... maybe I'm a loon?)...

g78lbn,gardening,Looking for advice: Trying to grow tree seedlings,"I am a little out of my element, I am actually a farmer by birth but we focus mostly on vegetables and all of the trees in our orchard are purchased/grafted. Idk if anyone has any knowledge, but I‚Äôm trying to grow trees from seed indoors just for fun, hopefully to add to the garden one day. I had a couple grow, but my germination rate on my first batch (variety of seeds) was about 8%. If that is exciting, just know that corn seed has a germination rate of 97-99%, so I‚Äôm very unhappy with 8% lol. I abandoned any that didn‚Äôt grow after 8 weeks to make room for the new seeds. Those seeds in batch 1 did not require any cold stratification, and the only seeds that grew required scarification. My second batch is red maples and something else (lost the bag), both required cold stratification for 8 weeks. I planted them about 10 days ago, no sprouts yet. I currently have the seed pots in a black tray on a heat mat, covered with a clear plastic top. I am trying to add just enough water to keep the soil moist. 
1) Theoretically sources say germination could take months. At what point do you say enough is enough and give up on a seed?
2) I am in Orlando, Florida. Should I attempt starting some of the seeds outside instead of indoors? 
3) If you have any other advice, please feel free to share. I would love to hear your germination rates, tips, tricks, set ups, time until germination.",12,/r/gardening/comments/g78lbn/looking_for_advice_trying_to_grow_tree_seedlings/

I'm also caring for my sister's old kale plants (she doesn't care about them anymore), which are still fruitful but also have atrocious amounts of insects on them. I've trimmed all of the aphid-covered branches and mulched them far away from the bushes. So now that the population is trimmed out, how do I deter future population from forming?

I have wild chives and a bunch of onion seeds and onion starts to plant, which were going to get planted around leafy greens primarily as bug deterrents (and then later on, like when I want some onions, I can dig some up). So I thought biodynamic processes also suggest that leaving bug deterrents growing in the backyard might also help to reduce the insect populations.... But y'all know as well as me that there's a big difference between sitting next to your medicine, and using it!

So what if I made teas from these things and then sprayed them on? So I'm watering my plants periodically with mint tea (after watering, so the tea sticks to the spot more) that is organic, natural, and wholesome! And the same could be done with onion water, like a blended up onion left to soak in some water.

Is that doable, does anybody have any experience with this? Thanks. (I'd consider an essential oil but fear it may harm my plants, and I thought if herbal teas contain the same compounds then it'd do the same trick. Thanks again!)",11,/r/gardening/comments/fsvqej/is_mint_tea_useful_for_pest_deterrent/

I don't have any experience gardening, save for what I learned in an agroecology course back in undergrad (mostly scientific concepts rather than agricultural practices).  I'm looking for a resource to guide me through this process, but the [sheer number has become overwhelming to the point of being anxiety inducing](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2NHLFdK16uU/T3mU5fc6x0I/AAAAAAAAA8U/8MdUXKXlEHo/s1600/e407e36c250d102d94d7001438c0f03b.gif).  So, if there were one or two books you had to recommend for a neophite such as myself, what would they be?  I'm hoping for something comprehensive rather than several that delve into particular aspects of production, but many of these focus on homesteading and are more involved than I'm looking for at this point.  I generally prefer the ""Mother Gaia loving"" approaches (e.g., permaculture, agroecology, etc.), but am an engineer at heart when it comes to how I learn (i.e., I love spreadsheets). I checked out some of Carol Deppe's books and wasn't too crazy about them.  I like the Will Bonsall and Ben Falk books from Chelsea Green, but find that a bit bigger scale than what I'm attempting to do.  Thanks for the help!

PS.

I‚Äôve been slowly working on this, but have found that the work load involved in tearing out the grass is really prohibitive. Each spring I work on a small area, and now have two flower gardens and a fenced in area of the backyard (fence to keep the dogs out) that has raised beds. In the summer the ground gets so hard that tearing out the grass is insanely difficult work, and I just don‚Äôt have the energy to do large areas after work and on the weekends (or ever, really, when it‚Äôs that difficult). 

I want to make some serious progress on the front yard this year (it‚Äôs much larger than the back). Currently the front yard isn‚Äôt used or seen by us at all except to mow‚Äîwhich I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt have to tell you guys, sucks a bunch. Our driveway comes off a side road and we use the back door, the front isn‚Äôt fenced so the pups can‚Äôt be with us out there, so it just feels like wasted space that only serves to torture us with mowing. I‚Äôd love to turn it into some gardens to cut down on mowing and provide some food. 

So, does anyone have any tips on how to convert large areas of lawn into a gardening space without killing myself in manual labor? All the other areas I‚Äôve removed the grass in rolls, but I just can‚Äôt see that as a viable option for such a large area‚Äîespecially when we don‚Äôt need the grass and the ground is already hardening up with lack of moisture (red clay soil, the joys).

fzzgy8,gardening,Question about seeds germinating,"Following a how-to video that made everything look super simple, I sealed some seeds on damp paper towels and left them on a heat mat for over a week. The seeds in question are beet, carrot, parsley, basil, bell pepper, roma tomato, and lavender. So far, the only seeds that have germinated are the basil. I am planning on transferring them to soil today. Did I do something wrong that the other seeds are not germinating? I know some, like carrots, can take a long time but I am wondering if I should have just direct seeded them. Is it too late to transfer some of the seeds to soil and let them try to germinate there? Should I just leave the seeds where they are and try planting more in soil separately and see what has more success? I'm worried about running out of time.

Also, for the basil since the sprout is teeny tiny should I leave it on the heat mat (in the soil) until it sprouts high enough to see sunlight?

Thanks in advance!",11,/r/gardening/comments/fzzgy8/question_about_seeds_germinating/

So what can I do to up-pot these guys since getting new pots now seems impossible.  Ive checked a bunch of Canadian mail order sites, and they either dont have stock, or the pricing  is ridiculously high 2$ per pot etc.

g1rc0g,gardening,Pruning Brand New Crepe Myrtle,"Hi Everyone! 

Late last summer I transplanted a sprout of my grandmother's prized Crepe Myrtle from Missouri to North Carolina - I wanted a piece of her with me always. Once it was planted in my yard I made sure to take good care of it however it was too late in the season for it to start leafing or blooming, it was just the main stem system. I was THRILLED when the branches started turning green and looking lively.

Fast forward through our fairly mild winter and here we are with the Myrtles starting to leaf out. Since they are EVERYWHERE in NC, I'm looking at the well established ones and notice that they are greening from the top... Mine is starting to green from closer to the base with probably a few inches of branch at the top. The plant itself is probably not even a foot tall but is sturdy in the ground. 

Should I just let it do it's thing this year or should I prune back what's not growing leaves? I don't want to shock it too much. 

TIA!",11,/r/gardening/comments/g1rc0g/pruning_brand_new_crepe_myrtle/

g8hexg,gardening,Struggling with treating edema in greenhouse tomatoes,"I discovered my tomato plants were showing signs of edema about a month back. About two weeks ago, I started making some changes recommended online (letting the soil dry out, running a fan to increase air circulation, spacing the plants out more) but so far it seems like the edema is just the same - clear crystalline water blisters on the underside of leaves, twisted leaves, branches curling down, white spots on the stem that burst when touched. The containers they‚Äôre in have tons of drainage holes, so water isn‚Äôt pooling in there. I did unpot a few to check the moisture below the surface level and it didn‚Äôt seem excessively wet ‚Äî somewhat damp near the root ball, but that‚Äôs it. Roots looked healthy and white.

Im struggling with what else to try to get them to perk up and resolve the edema. Some of them are pretty sad looking, don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll make it. Am I being too impatient, do they need more time?",11,/r/gardening/comments/g8hexg/struggling_with_treating_edema_in_greenhouse/

fsyv4s,gardening,"Advice for severely waterlogged garden? Gardening noob, starting from scratch!","Hello all. This is my first post! Hopefully I can get some advice here :)


SUMMARY:

My father‚Äôs garden becomes severely waterlogged for extended periods in wet weather. The soil is full of stones. It‚Äôs been recently cleared of a jungle of weeds and we‚Äôre looking to create a pleasant environment. Hopefully eventually having chickens. Any advice? 


MORE INFO:

Regarding the waterlogging: think of a row of houses with private back gardens, and behind those gardens is a public park (there‚Äôs a pic in my profile). The park always flooded when it rained ‚Äì this is Scotland, it rains a lot. In order to allow children‚Äôs football clubs to play, the council (local government) did drainage work in the park, and since then whenever there is rain/during winter the private gardens become severely waterlogged. In summer when there‚Äôs dry weather it‚Äôs fine. 

This is the main issue I‚Äôm looking for advice for!


OTHER ISSUE:

I believe the soil quality is poor. I‚Äôm not good with technical terms, but when you walk over the soil it feels soft and your feet sink into it quite deeply in some places. There‚Äôs also many stones mixed in. 


EXTRA:

Eventually I hope my dad can keep some chickens in his garden. Personally it‚Äôs important to me that I can achieve this for my dad. But of course I would never let them live in an unacceptable environment, so that‚Äôs why I want the waterlogging issue fixed!
I‚Äôm also aware there could be a lot of work involved, I‚Äôm not worried about that and I‚Äôm not looking for a magic fix, just any advice! Thank you!

fuv8rd,gardening,Suggestions on where to start?,"Good morning garden folks, I've got a question for you guys...i want to get one going in the back yard as I miss my garden from my prior house....and now I've got more space! My prior one was built up and much smaller and simpler so I'm stumped on where to go as I want to get it right the first time rather than having to keep fixing screw ups haha. This is what I envisioned:

- three 8x8 beds a foot away from the fence and each other for mobility

- built above the ground to give me the ability to flatten the beds out as the yard is on a slight grade

Doing the math I'll need about 10.5 cubic yards of dirt (18 in deep). I would probably still need to go through and remove all the grass and weeds currently there and put down plastic to prevent future weed growth...but is all of that worth it? Should I just remove the grass and weeds and work with what's there? Interested to know thoughts and suggestions. Thanks guys :)

fwgr7h,gardening,Should I gain Permission or anonymously plant 100 nationally endangered plants?," The plant I will plant: [Muehlenbeckia Astonii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muehlenbeckia_astonii) (2800ish wild plants left)

Getting permission to plant them would mean contacting reserves to plant them on their land they could completely deny it and boom, Planting them anonymously would easily connect to me, getting into trouble.

Anonymously could mean people could come along and rip them out since they wouldn't be protected.

So this is why I'm very conflicted. I can't wait for your answer!

fwnzfc,gardening,Your experiences with composting?,"So I'm proposing that a compost be built in the cafeteria at my university and be used to fertilize the community gardens.

fwo7yv,gardening,Really overwhelmed by my parents' yard which is overgrown with invasive vines and wild roses. What do I do?,"Hi r/gardening,

I am currently home from University due to COVID-19 and now that I have a bit more free time, plus energy and good weather, I really want to deal with my (my parent's) yard. In the last 10 years or so it has become overrun with wild vines and wild roses (I think Oriental Bittersweet and multiflora rose). It's mostly in the back section of our yard and along the sides and many of the vines and thorns are hanging towards/into our neighbors' yards. My parents have been very bad at maintaining it but my dad puts in some effort and so it hasn't spread much now but it comes back full force every year in the areas where it is still growing. About two years ago, after significant encouragement from me, we hired a professional, who came and mowed down a huge amount of the vines and thorns but didn't actually take out the roots (I'm not sure why but my parents may have told him they would do that part themselves). Since then, many of the areas he cut down have grown back because again, my parents did nothing to maintain the yard. 

Now that I'm home I want to deal with this problem because I really, really want space to garden (specifically grow vegetables). But every year I end up fighting with invasive plants to try and clear a space to grow stuff in, and I run out of time to actually plant anything. So far this year I've mostly been trying to cut down everything close to the base (so that it's easier to work on later when the branches and leaves don't get in the way) but I know this isn't a long-term, sustainable solution. I honestly feel like hiring a professional is the way to go (again, but maintain it this time) but I know that it's probably not super easy to hire someone right now given the global situation.

Does anyone have any advice? Do I try to tackle one area and clear it out completely and let everything else grow until I can get to it? Should I try to cut down everything and then go back and get roots later? I'm really at a loss and could use help coming up with a game plan.

The other three I‚Äôll plant in buckets and possible extend my planter box to accommodate them at some point but I need to keep the box smallish for now for transportation purposes.

Is there some website that categorizes every plant into their family (with latin family names), and shows or links the plants that are in a certain family? For example (I'm sorry if I'm butchering it, I'm new to flora) all succulents, all bonsais, all ferns, all mushrooms, etc.? 

On another note: Is there a comprehensive guide for cat owners, which house plants and garden plants are poisonous for cats? Mine likes to lick and chew every stone and leaf she finds in the garden. I want to grow some more new plants that I haven't got yet, and it'd be cool if there was a list of cat-friendly house/garden/wild plants for example.

g35wg3,gardening,waiting for a heat mat...should i use another method while i wait?,"hi! this is my first post but i'm happy to be here!

i am germinating seeds for the first time ever. i sort of jumped into the process quickly + on a whim and thought i had all my bases covered until i realized i overlooked making sure i'd have a way to properly maintain heat for the seeds. i think i was assuming since i'm doing this indoors, my indoor temp would be warm enough but its definitely not. for context: i'm germinating a couple dwarf sunflower varieties that will end up in larger plastic barrels on our porch once they're big enough to be planted. 

i have since ordered a heat mat + thermostat for them but those wont arrive for a few days. i've already planted my seeds and covered with plastic. it's such a weird in between temp. outdoors right now in that its chilly but not enough so to kick on our radiators or i would use those, as i've read that can be a good option in a pinch.

**my main question:** should i just wait for the heat pad to arrive and not worry about providing heat for a few days? or should i try to figure out a temp. solution while i wait? i've read about methods with a crock pot...but ive also read about needing to keep them at a regulated temp once they are being heated so i'm not sure if switching heat sources a few days in would be good for them. thanks in advance for any input!",10,/r/gardening/comments/g35wg3/waiting_for_a_heat_matshould_i_use_another_method/

After living here for months and watching her take care of hers, I completely trust her to take care of plants that I've invested in (building the beds, soil, nutrients and seeds, etc). I was going to build beds for her but her and my landlord are interested in cutting those plastic large drums in half to use as pots. For good reasons too. Since they will be home taking care of the plants 66% of the time I will not argue with them. 

I'm trying to locate drums for the pots and I've found a few that were used in mechanical work. Will it be safe to use drums like this as long as I clean and sterilize with bleach, probably a couple of times, before putting soil in them? I will thoroughly clean with softer cleaning supplies to get the traces of bleach out too.

g602oi,gardening,Garden pests,"I have a small urban garden full of flowers. But right now between aphids, cutworm and slugs I just want to cry... 

My roses are completely covered in aphids, they're also attacking my strawberries, herbs and seedlings. I've sprayed them twice now with neem oil. It seems to help, but consistency is needed or they just bounce fully back. I don't know if the strawberries will still be edible or if I'm also killing pollinators now. Are there any other environmentally friendly, but highly effective solutions against aphids?

I started noticing cutworms last year. I didn't know what they were, I thought it's just some weird looking earthworm. Obviously not... Nasty little buggers, ugly grey things shaped like a ""c"" if you uncover them in daytime. Hiding in soil and in or under plant pots. I've got a nasty nasty infestation of them now! They're constantly beheading my seedlings, they've beheaded my peonies, my African daisies are in full bloom but their leaves look like someone charged at them with a machine gun, and the leaves of my alliums are halfway eaten off and the crowns are covered in droppings. I keep finding them under every pot, in pots, in the garden, even in some pots indoors. At this point I just want to nuke them to hell for good. I ordered BTK (Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki) and I'm wondering if I can actually combine that in parallel with beneficial nematodes. As in apply both treatments at the same time, what do you think? I hope neither of these affect too much pollinators and earthworms. I'm afraid I may damage butterflies, though. Also, how does one normally apply these? On the soil, at the base of the plants, on the whole plant? Because I've obviously got more than one type of cutworms: the ones that cut off the base of young plants, and the ones that crawl all over mature plants and munch on them. 

And another fun thing, slugs. Last year they were a huge pest for my dahlias. The dahlias are coming up soon again, so I'm expecting them to get fully covered in slugs again. I ordered some of that stuff that you sprinkle at the base of the plant to deter slugs, I hope it works. No idea what it's made up of, but they claim it's not harmful for humans, animals or pollinators. 

Any thoughts and advice are welcome... I've only had the garden for 2 years now. And it brings me great joy to see it always in colourful bloom with bumblebees buzzing around in the middle of the day.",10,/r/gardening/comments/g602oi/garden_pests/

I've got them under an old 2 x 40W T12 fluorescent fixture I found in my attic with new daylight/blue bulbs. The seeds have sprouted, and the seedlings seem to be doing well. I've been leaving the lights on 24 hours.

Some sources say you should use an 18 on/6 off light cycle with seedlings; others say it doesn't matter and you can keep the lights on all the time. Still others say that you reach a point of diminishing returns with 18 hours and should shut the lights off simply to save electricity, but this involves plant cultivation on a much larger commercial scale. (And much of this discussion, when you google it, pops up on cannabis growing websites, so it's only about one plant.)

I then went out and bought 4 of bags Kellogg‚Äôs organic mix. When I was there I asked the worker if I need anything else to add, he suggested some manure. I added it to my beds, but they needed more soil. So I went back and bought 2 more bags and decided I should get manure too and keep the ratio of manure to soil going. So in total I have 6 Kellogg‚Äôs organic soil and 1 and half steer manure bags in my beds. My friend said  that my Kellogg‚Äôs already had manure and I might‚Äôve added too much.

Is the weed barrier strong enough if I use something like the thick plastic stuff I see on youtube? would all of the soil just wash out even with the 1 foot overhang underneath?

It's $70 for a 300 foot long 4 foot wide roll and 6 foot t-posts are only $3.89 each. If I place a support every 3 feet that's 10 T posts and 30 feet of barrier for a 12' x 3' x 3' raised bed. $38.90 in T-posts and the initial $70 for the barrier but we're only using 30/300 feet, so we can either double it up to strengthen it or we have enough material for 9 more beds. Essentially if we use it all we're looking at $46 per bed. Anything comparable to this with the same height is easily triple that.

fu7bil,gardening,Habanero seeds germination problem (browning roots),"Hello there, new gardener here. I'm trying to germinate some pepper seeds, almost all of them germinated including some ghost peppers. But so far I had no luck with habanero peppers. I tried to plant them in containers, still no sign after 25+ days. About a week ago I tried to germinate them using paper towel method. I soaked them in water for about 6 hours, placed them between wet paper towel then into a ziploc bag and put them near my radiator.  While other seeds germinated just fine, habanero seeds first started growing white roots (after 3-4 days) then they started turning brown and their growth stopped.

We have 2 trees out front, between the sidewalk and the street. Both were planted by the city over 5 years ago (they were here when we moved in). One does not appear to be doing so well... it's much smaller, has a few dead branches every year, and also blooms less and later than the healthy one.

Today I noticed the sick one has what appears to be rot at the base - dark flaky bark (image below). I noticed something similar a few years ago with a larger tree in the backyard that had fallen completely over during an ice storm.

Does this mean the tree is rotting inside?

fuhiv6,gardening,Cactus - rotting? Please help!!,"Hi,

I need help with my cactus. Below is a link (I hope I did this right) with 4 pictures of it's current state. I took these pictures just now. As you can see, it is turning brown and mushy from the bottom-up.   

Four days ago, I clipped off a portion from part of the cactus that did not appear light brown and mushy on the outside (though as of today, it now does look brown and mushy). From that clipping, I clipped a smaller piece off. Picture #2 in the link below shows the cactus where I clipped the main piece off, and picture #4 shows the original clipping (the piece on the left) and the second, mini-clipping (the piece on the right). When I cut the piece off, the tissue inside the cactus looked all green, though there was a little bit of white right in the center (as seen in picture #2). 

My goal with cutting off the piece was to try and repot it, in the event rotting was the problem. I read that you should let the clipping sit out in a cool, dry place for about a week to let it callus over before repotting it. However, since setting it aside, the sides of the cactus are sort of curling down and over the tissue. It looks like it is just shriveling up. Is this normal? Do I just repot it like this? Is rot even the issue here? 

Please help me! It seems that whatever the brown stuff is, it is moving pretty fast - just 4 days ago the piece I cut from was not brown, but as of today, it is. I love all the new baby growths coming in, and want to try to save them if possible.

Thank you!
Amy

fvfg7r,gardening,Removing Poison Ivy Roots?,"I had a bad poison ivy infestation in my front yard.  I bought this house only about 2 years ago and my lawn guy mentioned the poison ivy, but I was unaware how bad it had gotten.  Given my sudden...free time.  I have spent the last week or two clearing it out.  I pulled all the vines off of trees and pulled up every plant that was visible in the ground.  The more I pull, the more I realize how intricate the root system is.  I have filled about 12 wheelbarrows full of poison ivy vines and roots that had started to cascade around my yard.  I have pulled out 3 large plants that seemed to be the concentration of the root system, but I continue to find more roots, the more I pull.  What is the best way to continue getting rid of this?  I have been working for about 20 man hours on pulling vines and although I previously thought of myself as immune to the poison, my repeated exposure has started to give me a rash.  (Yes, I'm wearing protective clothing and being careful.)  I've been reading about Roundup, but from what I can tell you spray directly on the leaves.  There are no more leaves, just roots and the occasional shoot that is coming up out of the ground.  Will it do anything to spray directly on the ground?  A combination of the ivy and an incline in my yard has killed all the grass in this corner, so my plan is to seed for grass when I'm all finished clearing the poison ivy.  Any thoughts?",1,/r/gardening/comments/fvfg7r/removing_poison_ivy_roots/

I recently had my house treated because I got sick of capturing wasps (sometimes in my bed where they would sting me) and taking them outside, only to have them fly back in ten minutes later. I tried my best the nonviolent way, taking their umbrella nests down (black wasps), patching small areas up around a window or door, and other methods of deterring them ultimately to no success. I shopped around for a pest control company and found one that seemed like the best. They used Alpine WSG and another pesticide/repellant (I forget which one) but basically an odorless pesticide was sprayed inside and outside my home, and a repellant was sprinkled around.

It‚Äôs worked but I hate sometimes coming across an Insect like a wasp, or a beetle, or a misquoto hunter on the ground struggling to survive. I know I‚Äôm a big softie but hey, they could easily do that to us with the technology that exists today and a little cloud seeding.

Anyway, does anywhere here know effective repellants that keep bugs away from your home? So far it hasn‚Äôt harmed the big bumble bees which is nice but I just feel bad about the whole thing.

I've had great luck with sedum and plan to use a lot of varieties but there's not a lot of interesting color variation.  I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations for flowers (perennials preferred) that have a similar temperament as sedum so the sun/water combo of the location of this garden meets the needs of the whole garden?

fwlp6q,gardening,Starting a garden in Douglas Fir/cedar forest soil?,"Hi friends! 

I plan on starting a food garden! I live on about a half acre of heavily forested Douglas fir and cedar forest on the Washington pacific coast. Our land was originally logged in the 1800s, but was then untouched until the 1970s when the house was built. It was then pretty much untouched (a person‚Äôs vacation house) until we bought it last year. 

I have a generally cleared area that I‚Äôll be clearing further. It has decent light exposure. My question is, will this soil be conducive to growing? It has years and years of grasses, mosses, and tons of fir and cedar needles that left a rich, black soil. I plan on clearing/leveling it, then using the moves soil to make the garden. Any thoughts?

fwmf5z,gardening,Beginner Here! I have a weed control question.,"Hello everyone! 

I am trying to improve my gardening skills a bit. I rent my house, and so am not trying to go nuts with buying things to landscape, but I like to do what work I can to fix things. 

In the past few days, I have been trying to manually uproot the weeds in some of the trickier spots around my yard and raised bed. I've got to a few of them, but I'm under no illusions that I could truly get them all out. There are too many, and it's too far gone. That said, I do believe in partial improvement, so I plan to keep at it unless told not to. 

My main question right now is this - if I get a full weed plant pulled up, but don't immediately dispose of it, does that dramatically increase the likelihood that it will either spread seeds and sprout new weeds, or reestablish itself, or, once I have the thing uprooted and lying on the lawn, have I effectively killed it? 

I know I'll go back through and dispose of a lot of it, but I don't know how paranoid I should be.",1,/r/gardening/comments/fwmf5z/beginner_here_i_have_a_weed_control_question/

I'm originally from the UK but I live in Canada now so this year's seedling have only been going for a few weeks but I'm interested to find out about pinching out.¬†

I'm growing quite a variety of plants and although I've been able to find information about pinching out some of them, such as cosmos and dahlia, I'm left unsure about others. If you have any knowledge or experience with pinching out the following seedlings such as how tall they should be please help. The ones I'm not sure about are

Verbena Quartz
Verbena Tuscany¬†
Bacopa
Lobellia
Snapdragon candy tops
Pansy

fwqsr4,gardening,Easy Flower Seed Mix,"We have a couple of bare spots in our yard I would love to fill with flowers to give a pop of color as well as attract things like butterflies, bees, or even hummingbirds. 

I'm just having a hard time deciding what to place there. One spot is right next to our back deck, under our chestnut tree so receives a lot of shade. The other spot is on the opposite side of our deck separated by a brick pathway, and against our house (wood cedar siding if that makes any difference). It's fairly shaded as well, gets more early morning sun but the chestnut trees shade it pretty much the rest of the day. Both bare spots are outlined with ""monkey grass"" that will produce little purple flowers later in the spring or summer (I forget when exactly because my husband is horrible about weed eating the stuff down before it can bloomü§¶). 

I thought about getting one of those seed mixes for butterflies and hummingbirds, but when looking at the details it looks like a lot of the flowers get really really tall. Ends up looking like kind of an overgrown mess when spread in small areas instead of something like a field. I want something that won't grow so tall that it over takes the low deck (it's just 1 step up from the ground). 

Any suggestions on what flower seeds would be good to spread out in these spaces? I don't mind if they're annuals or perennials.

The area that I am in has no available compost because of the coronavirus lockdown.  So a local grocery store was selling Cow Manure pellets and I was going to use it as a substitute.  I am questioning if it is more like a fertilizer than a compost and how should i use it.  I have raised bed gardens with a mixture of Coco coir and local soil.  I was hoping to improve it using some compost but cow pellets is what I have.

I'm a total beginner at this, and when directions on the internet said it needed a certain cold period to sprout, I assumed keeping the seeds in a cold place before sowing them would be good. Around halfway through March, I sowed them under glass in a greenhouse, and they have been subject to 20+ degrees celcius temperatures for weeks, and without their cold stratification they haven't sprouted yet.

So my question is, can I ""fix"" their cold stratification? I just moved my seed trays back into the basement; would keeping them there for three or four weeks give them the cold stratification they need?",1,/r/gardening/comments/fxpevo/advice_needed_can_i_fix_my_seeds_cold/

fy1251,gardening,Should I separate seedlings that grew from the same pellet?,"Hi, it's my first time attempting a flower garden and I have a question about spacing. I generally followed the spacing that the package of the seeds said. I started my seeds in Jiffy pellets, and then transplanted them to some above ground garden boxes. 

For things like Zinnias, Nasturtiums, Bachelor's Buttons, etc. I separated the seedlings so only one was planted. However, I also planted some Alyssum and I actually left 2-3 seedlings together planted in the same spot. Some Five Spots also have 2-3 seedlings together in the same spot.

Should I separate them? Should I complete remove the extra seedlings or can I just space them out a bit more?

I also had two Nasturtium seed germinate late in one of the pellets, so I have a Nasturtium that now has one large seedling, and two smaller seedlings. What happens if I just let them grow together? Stunted growth?

I tried doing some googling but I can't find much on having two or three seedlings right beside each other. As a general rule of thumb is best to only let one seedling grow?

Im at a bit of a loss here as i know next to nothing about gardening but the kids really need a nice garden to play in with all thats going on.

In short the house we purchased has around 80m2 of grass out the back but its completely dead, no way its coming back in my opinion. My initial thought was to lift and relay a new lawn but with the hot Australian summer its solid and very hard to lift even in small patches.

Some resources ive seen online talk about the benefits of laying top soil over the existing lawn and then laying the new turf rather than lifting the old and starting from scratch.

g0gj5y,gardening,Growing vege-seedlings in pots in colder temperatures,"First, I might not use the correct ‚Äùgrowing-terms‚Äù below, but I hope I make myself clear. 

I have sown seeds (tomatoes, pumpkins, cucumbers etc.) in pots to plant in my garden when it is sufficiently warm outside. On the seed bags, it usually sais that when the seedling has surfaced, it wants a cooler temperature and much light. Usually, this cooler temp is defined as 16-20C, which is very rare to get inside in a sunny spot (especially when you have old radiators below every windowsil, that cannot be switched off individually). 

Now, I have a small, uninsulated house in my garden which generally keeps 1-2 C above the outside temp. To warm it to 16C would be insanely expensive (right now our nights are 0-7 C). However, I could put in a frost guard not letting it go below say 5C. Would the seedlings still grow in a reasonable mannen then or would it be too cold? The windows do not get that much light (large but facing north east/west), but I have some spare lamps with led-bulbs to help out.",1,/r/gardening/comments/g0gj5y/growing_vegeseedlings_in_pots_in_colder/

I've recently germinated and then placed mango seeds in pots for further growth. I have seen several videos in where they say to not cover the entire seed, cover the pot with a bag, etc.   


Yesterday, i found some white fungal growth on top of a seed. This morning, another one had it as well. They are in different pots. I was wondering why this has happened and if it will affect the growth of the actual plant? I saw one website that said it didnt, but I'd like to hear it from multiple sources.

I got a Kaffir lime a few weeks ago that came with three stems that are starting to cross over each other and generally to me seem crowded and tangled. I plan to re\_pot soon anyway, so is it worth separating them?

I also intend to keep the plant fairly small and bushy, has anyone had any luck with air pruning pots for citrus?

I have also noticed a discrepancy between the leaves of my plant especially on one particular stems. the older leaves are stiffer, smaller, waxier, have small petioles and aren't significantly fragrant. however i have noticed some newer leaves at the top of the plant that are significantly bigger, softer, have more balanced petioles and smell as expected of a kaffir lime is this normal?",1,/r/gardening/comments/g0oqiv/should_i_separate_my_kaffir_also_anyone_have_any/

g0qupj,gardening,Raised planter boxes,"My wife has requested some planter boxes for our backyard and prefers the style that props them up on legs if possible. Is there any suggestion for how to build and place them on a yard that currently contains grass? I'm worried that it will end up either sinking into the grass or leaving an ugly dead patch below the boxes. I'm also interested to find out what is the best way to do the bottom of the box. Wood slats spaced for drainage with an internal liner? A wire mesh cage?
  
Are these acceptable for vegetable gardens? Would this sink into the grass during the rainy months? I live in Vancouver BC. This was our first winter in this house and I noticed the yard had water underneath the lawn (I could hear it move like a wave as I walked around) 
  
This is the style she prefers! Thanks for any input, we're new at this!

g0wkbj,gardening,Completely new to this -- Where do I start? Milton Ontario Canada,"Dearest Internet,

I live in Milton Ontario, which according to [planthardiness.gc.ca](https://planthardiness.gc.ca) has the following ratings: 1961-1990 zone 5b | 1981-2010 zone 6a | 1961-1990 hardiness index 58 | 1981-2010 hardiness index 61 (haha, I'm not sure if that's important, I just think that it might be?).

The attached gif shows the back yard I'm working with.  It starts and stops looking at the back fence which is pretty dead on north east.

We were thinking about diving in to vegetable gardening, probably berries, definitely herbs too, with maybe some flower beds that would bloom at different times that we could cut from to have arrangements inside.

I trust reddit more than just googling though -- do any of you have advice?  I was hoping that the long stretch of fence on the property line facing North West would be ok to set up in -- don't want to have to move the kid's playhouse if possible.  Also keenly interested in book recommendations.  I should note that I have whatever the opposite of a green thumb is so far in my life, so we'd likely start smallish and build year by year.  I am, however, a huge nerd when it comes to planning and spreadsheets and I promise to send an update when it's all done.

The only other thing that I can think to add is that Milton is a bit notorious for rabbits.

Thanks for any advice!

g173r3,gardening,"New lawn, dead patches?","Hi, 

I laid a new lawn 3 weeks ago yesterday, it's seem to have taken well overall, I've been consistently watering it as we haven't had much rain.

However, there are about 4-5 small dead patches on it, the only thing I could possibly think of is my male dog could have urinated there? But I have tried to keep him from urinating on it and I've been watering it so that should've diluted any urine that was there? 

Does anyone have any suggestions of what the cause could be? I have sprinkled in some lawn seed and feed hoping this will help revive the patches. 

Another side question is that parts of the lawn are starting to flower, is this usual?

Do you want to start gardening with your pandemic mandated free time? Do you want to supply food for yourself to circumvent large supply chains and crowded grocery stores? Does this describe someone you know who isn't on Reddit or on this sub?

Growing your own food connects you to your food, the land you grow it on, the ecology that surrounds you, and the community that supports you. To encourage a household abundance of nutritious food and to establish those connections I want to offer as many people as possible seeds to start their own victory gardens. To stretch the resources as much as possible the total amount of seeds will be slightly under 1 ounce. It won't be enough for a 20 acre plot, but hopefully enough for the average home garden. Included in the letter is...

2 herbs (either basil, parsley, or dill)

Scallions

Red veined sorrel

Turnips

1 leafy green (either lettuce or kale)

1 fruiting crop (either cucumbers, tomatoes, or bell peppers)

The options are randomized and exist because I'll probably run out of one crop in the process of filling these. I'm sorry but I will probably not be able to accommodate special requests or mixes. These are free seeds for anyone who wants to grow food for themselves. 

If your interested in a small variety pack of seeds message your mailing address. I will send you the seeds and a small rant on why I think gardening is essential, and some basic instructions. Limit one packet per username. *See update*

It is still alive as I have scratch tested and it is green on the branches. They are also flexible without snapping.

g23o5p,gardening,My first garden! Looking for advice,"Hey y‚Äôall! First let me start by saying I love this sub. One of my favourites. Thanks for your lovely inspiring posts. (I‚Äôm on mobile btw)

I‚Äôm doing my first garden. I live in an apartment with a side yard so I was planning on doing container gardening. 

Then I had an idea - I got a tall bookshelf, an old beat up one that was basically free. I plan on laying it on it‚Äôs back and using it to plant veggies! 

It‚Äôs 11.5 inches deep. I feel like that‚Äôs deep enough for most vegetables, right? (First question)

It is 26.5 inches wide. And it is separated by shelves making 5 sections. One section is 10.5 inches, one is 17 and the other are about 13. All these are all 12 inches deep and 26.5 inches wide as previously mentioned. 

I‚Äôm in Nova Scotia by the way so I‚Äôll be planting outside soon. Probably next week. Is that good? (Second question)

I‚Äôm going to start green peppers, scallions, broccoli and tomatoes inside tomorrow. I believe I am running a little late on that. Will that be okay? (Third question)

I also want to do beans, cucumbers and some sort of squash maybe. What do you think of these choices? Any thing else you‚Äôd recommend in place of? Or do these sound good? (Fourth question)

I will only put compatible veggies together in the sections. If I plant a ‚Äúfoe‚Äù veggie in the section next to its enemy will that matter? Or not because there would be a shelf separating the two? (Fifth question)

I‚Äôm going to put a trellis for the beans to climb. And something for the tomatoes too. Anything I should know about the other veggies? (Sixth question)

Thank you so much if you read this novel. I am open to any suggestions or comments. 

I‚Äôm excited! Wish me luck

g33w8s,gardening,Question about fertilizer with soil blocks?,"First off, first time gardener here.  I've been reading and watching videos to start my garden.  I have been germinating in condiment cups with paper towels indoors, then I have transferred to \~2"" soil blocks after germination.  Everything seems to be going well.  Getting pretty high success rate in the blocks after germination and my plants are starting to sprout secondary leaves.  Here is where my question comes in.  A number of people have said that at this point, the energy/nutrients from the seed is basically spent and that I need to fertilize to keep the soil blocked plants alive long enough to move outside.  However...I think they are using a different soil block recipe than mine and they don't seem to have compost or any other nutrient rich matter in their soil block.  My soil blocks were made up of about 25% to 50% organic composted cow manure (percent varied as I tried to find a good consistency for the blocks).  Given that I have the composted cow manure in there, do I really need to fertilize on top of that??  If I do decide to fertilize, do I run any risk of damaging my tender seedlings?

A secondary question...how long should I give a germinated seed to break the soil before I give up on them (in general, I know plants vary)?  The reason I ask is I have a number of tomato plants (San Marzano) that are about 2 to 3 inches tall and are just starting to sprout 3rd leaves.  There are about 20 percent of the soil blocks that don't have plants breaking the surface yet though.  Are those goners?

g3hd2q,gardening,indoor hydrangeas: help!!,"hello, everyone!

(disclaimer: i‚Äôm really new to gardening so please be gentle.)

i currently have 2 potted hydrangeas. 1 in particular was purchased from a grocery store about 3 weeks ago and lately, the petals have been shriveling. can anyone tell me why? please note my growing conditions below:

1. because my apartment‚Äôs in a corner of a courtyard, my patio only receives sunlight for a limited time each day. i have LED grow lights that i use on the plant indoors in combination with natural sunlight on the patio. in total, the plant receives about 3-4 hours of light per day.

2. i transplanted the plant into a larger pot yesterday and saw that the roots had started to circle in the original container. i‚Äôm not sure if that contributed.

3. i just watered the plant today. I last watered the plant probably 3 days ago when the stems start to wilt. the stems perked up again slightly after that.

would love to get some input, especially from those who use grow lights!",1,/r/gardening/comments/g3hd2q/indoor_hydrangeas_help/

[here is a picture of the information on the box](https://i.imgur.com/WQh2VNJ.jpg). i don't see anything for the lumens, i only see ""luminous flux"", which i assume is a different unit for measuring brightness, because if it was lumens, why wouldn't it just say ""lumens"". i've tried looking up what luminous flux is, compared to lumens, and if there's a way to convert between the two, but none of the info i've found is helpful.  


from what i understand, growing vegetables needs more intense light than growing flowers, and they are trying to grow vegetables, so a really weak light won't cut it. i know walmart stuff is cheap and all, but we can just return them if they aren't what we need, so it's no big deal.",1,/r/gardening/comments/g3wm4u/can_someone_knowledgeable_with_grow_lights_give/

g430n0,gardening,Question for ventilation,"Hi!

I am new to this community and rarely use reddit, so I hope that I am doing this correctly. 

Recently I lost a succulent due to white fuzzy mold. It grew on the stem roots. Basically it broke off... Currently my other succulents are not facing this problem, but I want to make sure it doesn't happen to them either. I believe I am not having proper air ventilation, and I think it's because I live on the Oregon Pacific Northwest, so it gets cold sometimes to even open any windows. Secondly, my plants are in a converted living area in the basement, so it gets mildewy enough down here as it is. My plants have to be downstairs (basement) otherwise there is no room to put them.

I sometimes crack my window open in my room and have my succulents near them to get air. I only water them once a week, but I noticed that the soil is still moist and not dry even after a week has passed, which makes me think that there isn't enough airflow. 

I was thinking of buying a fan to have in my room or near my succulents to give them ventilation. Does anyone have any suggestions of what kind of fan should I buy? Should I buy a mini one directed towards the plants? One for my entire small/medium room? Please give suggestions of good fans!

Also, I will be sprinkling a tiny bit of cinnamon on the soil to best prevent the mold from happening again. Any help is appreciated

We bought three Ilex meserveae bushes that were called Royal Duo - apparently these bushes are actually each a male and female intertwined, so it should always produce berries. Pretty cool! These are planted in front yard.

Curious if any of you have experience with these.

We'd also like to get some Sky Pencil Hollies (Ilex crenata) but apparently this variety are female-only. 

Do the meserveae species pollinate the crenata? Or would I need a male crenata? If it's possible, are males able to pollinate females from the front yard to the back?

g5ljxk,gardening,Need advice! Black eyed susan seeds accidentally planted amongst jalapeno plants,"It's almost comical that this happened but I need some advice from the group on what to do here (or if there's even anything I can do). It's odd times right now but I setup two large rectangular trough pots to grow some items indoors about a week and a half ago. I planned to put black eyed susan seeds to germinate in one of them and my young jalapeno seedlings into the other so that they could get a little bigger before going outside.

Somehow, I completely forgot which trough had the black eyed susans and which was empty because I noticed this morning that the jalapeno trough was sparsely sprouting some new little leaves around the jalapenos... Face palm.

So, 1. What's going to happen to my jalapenos / black eyed susans if I do nothing? I'm guessing the jalapenos will eventually be overrun and killed by the larger population of BES but clearly I'm no expert. 2. If that is the case, would taking the jalapeno seedlings out and replanting away from the BES kill them (or affect the BES)?

I'm trying to grow basil, turmeric, garlic, lavender, radishes, spinach, rosemary and chamomile.

The basil seems to be doing the best. All of the other plants have become leggy and wither.

I can't get the turmeric rhizomes and ginger to sprout.

The radishes have sprouted bug again there's an issue with it becoming leggy and withering. I think the issue is sunlight so I got heating pads and grow lighting but everything is still withering.

I've recently removed an extremely large patch of succulents that were next to it, so I'm praying that will help although I don't know why it would.

g7613x,gardening,"Never owned a garden before, and I need HELP","Hi all. Me and my fiancee are first time home owners, and we have a front garden with a lawn and a backyard which is all concrete.

We've decided to focus on the front garden for now and we're a little lost as we've never had a garden before.

Firstly and most simply, we were wondering if anyone can identify [this plant.](http://imgur.com/gallery/JTsGJd5) - we have no idea what it's called, or whether it's meant to be yellow as it started blossoming with pink leaves initially and we're hoping it isnt dying. Should we expect any larger flowers? The bees seem to love it.

More complicated - we mowed the lawn, de-weeded the soil next to the lawn by hand, but didnt use any weedkiller, and lo and behold the weeds returned within a week. I was going to spray the soil with weed killer until I noticed [shoots](http://imgur.com/gallery/uM41Utj) that dont appear to be weeds. So it looks like we're going to have flowers soon!

If I was to spray weed killer just on the weeds, what are the chances of it killing off the flowers too?

When de-weeding we ended up moving a lot of soil too, and now theres next to no soil around the shoots. Would it be a good idea to move some soil back? Or do I risk suffocating the shoots by blocking sunlight etc

I'm sorry if some of these are really obvious, but we are total rookie gardeners.",1,/r/gardening/comments/g7613x/never_owned_a_garden_before_and_i_need_help/

Was using the hand saw to cut up a stack of old dead shed fronds from the GIANT date palms in our front yard. They need to be chopped up to fit into our green waste bin. 

These guys have a collection of widely spaced pointy Thor‚Äôs on the ends, about 10-20cm in length. No biggie I‚Äôm just cutting around them. I drop one of the fronds as it saws apart and it give me the *teeny tiniest* poke in the ankle as it hits the ground. 

Felt like a mosquito bite, did not remotely bleed or have a heavy impact. Didn‚Äôt break the spike either. I checked it, gave it a scratch, got on with my work. 

Five hours later my ankle starts to ache. Another hour and I can barely move it at all due to the intense pain. The following day it is swollen, bruised, and the slightest movement is causing me agony. I had a restless sleep and even a nightmare about brewing infection because it hurt so much even while I was sleeping. 

A little research has shown that these spikes break off a teeny weeny amount and bury soil bacteria into the skin, which causes ‚Äòarthritic‚Äô pain in the nearest joint capsule. It CAN lead to serious poorly infection that requires strong arthrocentesis testing and STRONG antibiotics to clear. 

I have since washed the area thoroughly and have been treating with and antiseptic lotion and limiting movement all day today. It seems to be clearing but  if it flares up again I‚Äôll be straight to the doctors.

g80yfp,gardening,Beginner gardener needs some help,"Hi all,

I have been reading this reddit for some time and wanted to share some lavender and rosemary I have been growing on our balcony. We are in zone 7b. 

Some of the lavender appears to be thriving (munstead) while the other two varieties seem to be struggling. (Pastor‚Äôs pride and hidcote)

Got some old rosemary that has been a hold over from last season. Want to make sure it survives and thrives the best it can now in a separate planter. 

Any thoughts on the condition of the plants would be helpful. All in a succulent based potting soil, drip irrigation set for 10 minutes every 3 days. 

Thanks.

g81bbn,gardening,"Neglected fig tree for 3 years, is it too late to make it thrive?","About 3 years ago, during my dad's visit at my house (he lives in another country) he planted a fig tree and a pear tree (both saplings) in my backyard. He took care of it himself for 3 months, and when he left he told me to water them regularly and fertilize them each spring so that they could grow well.

Embarrassing to say, being the lazy single guy I am, I completely left the poor plants by themselves. Basically did nothing to them. Natural rain water is all they got (and it's been dry here in Texas). No fertilizers either except for the first spring.

So 3 years have passed and the trees lived but didn't grow much. The fig tree produced about a dozen fruits each year (don't look very big or ripe, all got eaten by birds or other critters). The pear tree has nothing but leaves.

Pics:  [https://imgur.com/a/kmcp96S](https://imgur.com/a/kmcp96S) 

A neighbor commented lately that the fig tree would have been much bigger by now if I had taken care of it properly.

Now I really do want to start taking care of them, especially the fig tree. I want it to grow to a healthy size and produce nice edible figs.

But please forgive my ignorance as I know nothing about plants: is it too late to save the tree? Did it already miss some ""plant puberty"" or grow spurt like a human during childhood/teenage years, so that its growth potential would be forever limited? Does it make sense to start over with a new tree?

g8dhy2,gardening,What is wrong with my led light grown radishes,"Hello, I have a grow closet setup with a 45W LED light (true consumption 25-30W). I've planted carrots, beetroot, radishes, spinach and kale seeds under it. Initially, they were all growing looking nice and healthy, the radish seemed to get a little bit leggy towards the light, but the stem was sturdy and the leaves looked great, large and green, it started growing true leaves. However, in the last week, the initial leaves started to yellow and dry on a couple of the radish plants and some of the true leaves also seem to catch a yellow nuance. I've been keeping the light at 12"" (~30cm), running it for 14 hours a day, as suggested in the specs it came with. I've been watering regularly, but not overwatering, the soil has been constantly wet, but not soaked. Could this be from too little light? Or too much (leaf burn). All the other plants look great and are not leggy or yellow at all.

g92mlv,gardening,Trouble with Paw Paws,"So, I have a question.
I'm trying my hand at growing Paw Paws, and I totally get if a lot of people haven't seen / Heard / whatever about them. I recently discovered them myself.
But for those that have heard of them, I was wondering if you knew anything about how long certain varieties come out of dormancy? 

Three of my paw paws are alive, and well, and coming out of being dormant just fine, but the fourth one seems to be taking a lot longer. I'm hoping I don't have a dead plant, and after a bit of research I've found that paw paws generally come out of their dormant state in roughly 16 days. This one seems to be refusing to do that.

Any thoughts? Thank you in advance.",1,/r/gardening/comments/g92mlv/trouble_with_paw_paws/

The seeds just arrived. Our cottage is Canada zone 4A and we currently cannot access the property as the bridges between the two provinces are restricted to essential personnel only. We suspect that will change in the next month. 

Is it too late to start the seeds at home? Should I wait until I can get to the cottage and sow them some time this summer?

I used to help my family often with gardening, however not much was actually explained why to me. I moved to a town for college and I live in the middle of a downtown area with no outdoors. Theres not even a real park in this place. How do people survive?! Unfortunately due to fiances and covid, I'm stuck here in this town longer than I want to be. 
 For my nature and outdoor loving sanity I want to trt to make a little garden in my apartment somewhere. Unfortunately, I have no outdoor space and I'm not allowed to do window boxes. But! I have a feel windowsill I can place some type of shelf on to stack plants on. Now, for my question. What plants do you think would be newbie friendly and tiny apartment friendly? I have tried to have plants in here before but because of my health some time in a hospital killed them. Im also always confused as to how often to water things- so as clear as possible on that would be amazing (I'm autistic and the language of ""moist"" or ""keep wet"" is just confusing to me. How moist? How many days a week do I water it?) 
Here's what I was thinking, and of course I will do more research I just have no clue where to begin and y'all seem nice enough to help a hermit like me.
For vegetables/fruits, celery, tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers were always a stable in my family garden. Id love to get those going again.
For flowers, I'm not sure. I was thinking maybe things like babys tears, creeping Charlie, some type of climbing ivy and a spider plant? Two of the poor plants lost to health were an ivy and a spider plant. (Rip isley and Peter).

This is really the first time that we've done anything like this so I'm sorry if any of these questions are stupid. I pretty much have no idea what I'm doing aside from what I've been able to glean from internet research the past few weeks. 

We know the basics of what we want - two beds on both sides of the house with three dwarf lilac bushes in each and filled with a white rock.

I'm just wondering if there's anything we need to do besides just putting the lilacs in the ground and then filling the beds with the rock.

For instance, I've seen mixed reviews on landscaping fabric. Personally, after pulling up tons of it all with a good layer of dirt and weeds on top, I'm no fan of the stuff, but the previous beds were (initially) covered with mulch, not rock, so I don't know if that makes a difference. I've also seen a layer of cardboard under the rocks suggested. 

Should I put anything around the lilacs to help them grow? Like mulch under the rock or something? Fertilizer? Compost?

Zone 5b, if it makes a difference.

g9qafd,gardening,Brooklyn NY Vine Combination?,"Hi Gardeneers! I would like to plant a mix of vines on my south-facing, full sun concrete block wall (really ugly) in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, NY, USA. I'd like it to be evergreen so it hides the wall year round. I'd like flowering vines in the spring and throughout the summer intermingled around the evergreen background.

Could I get your advice on which species to mix together? Are there pitfalls to consider? I've done a bit of googling and have the following ideas:

&amp;#x200B;

Idea 1 (Colorful theme):

\- Star Jasmine for the evergreen in winter and white flowers in summer. I'm concerned about this surviving a cold winter though.

\- Winter Jasmine for yellow winter flowers.

\- Clematis [""Jolly Good""](https://www.provenwinners.com/plants/clematis/jolly-good-clematis-sp) for summer flowers or some mix of group 1 and group 2 Clematis.

&amp;#x200B;

Idea 2 (Yellow theme):

\- Hedera Helix [""Anne Marie""](https://www.gardenia.net/plant/hedera-helix-anne-marie) (which seems to be ok in full sun) for the most bomb-proof evergreen background I can think of. Also, I'm thinking this will root to the wall and be physically behind the other vines.

\- Carolina jessamine intermingled into the ivy.

\- Winter Jasmine used sparingly for yellow interest in winter.

g9wvn8,gardening,"Basil, Oregano, and Peppermint not growing in herb garden? Advice?","I have an herb garden, and this is my 1st year trying to grow herbs. In the image linked below, there is greek oregano on the left, peppermint in the middle, and basil on the right...

So the soil ph is \~7.5, sulphur is arriving this weekend, I'm going to lower it by one or two points. I water 3 times daily, as our California soil is bad at holding water, and even with fertilizer, my plants are dry as bones in this summer heat with only two waterings.

The oregano was the 1st of the three to be planted, and it was/is doing okay, but it stopped growing and one of its branches shriveled up and dies for seemingly no reason? Hasn't happened again

The peppermint was next, and half the plant dies that week. Though none more of the plant has died, I cannot figure out why it did in the first place. It will not grow, but it is not dead.

The basil is yellow during the midday sun, but green at other times, it is growing very slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why they are having such bad luck... rosemary and sweetmint are growing in the same bed and they are thriving. Any obvious reason they are faltering?

All comments are appreciated, thank you in advance :)

g9xjra,gardening,A suggestion for the sub on how to ask for advice.,"I've noticed a trend over the last couple weeks of people asking for ""tips"" in regards to learning how to garden. It's hard to give good advice when you don't know what the question is. People who are seeking knowledge might try instead asking for specific advice. 

Want to grow zucchini but your soil is mostly rocks and dust? Never tried to plant or grow peonies? Want to learn more about pH? Ask! Be specific and more people can help. Vague questions get vague answers. 

And if you want to know ""everything"" you gotta find a focus point. You can't learn everything at once, so focus on one thing at a time.",1,/r/gardening/comments/g9xjra/a_suggestion_for_the_sub_on_how_to_ask_for_advice/

g9xq3z,gardening,Help recovering overwatered in-ground citrus.,"I have 2 citrus trees, one orange, one lemon that i transfered from pots to the ground in late january (lows then were in the 50s.) The trees are babies, maybe 2 feet tall. The soil here does not drain well, so i amended it with coco coir, perlite, and vermiculite, but a month or 2 after transplanting i got telltale signs of overwatering. I was saturating the ground about once per week since they are planted in full sun and the temps recently have climbed into the 90s. Since the symptoms started showing, i went about 3 weeks without watering. The yellowing on the new growth has gotten noticeably better, but the leaves are still quite rolled, almost into cylinders. The leaves and stems are still turgid and have no other signs except the rolled leaves and no new growth for several weeks. The temps here are already into the triple digits and we have essentially no rain/cloud cover. The top of the soil around the trees is completely bone dry as far down as i can poke my finger. Im hesitant to check further for fear of damaging the already-stressed roots.

My worry is that the plants will go from over watered to underwatered very quickly (i read a story about some citrus trees that died after being left in a ""hot"" garage without water for 3 days). Since the signs of over and under watering watering are so similar, i am really at a loss of how to proceed. I am very tempted to give the poor guys a drink, especially when i break a sweat in the 2 minutes it takes to check on them, but i know that if they are still overwatered, that will just make things worse. Wait? Water? Something else entirely?

Many thanks.",1,/r/gardening/comments/g9xq3z/help_recovering_overwatered_inground_citrus/
