fuv5jx,Coronavirus,"We’re a group of teenagers that founded our own nonprofit dedicated to youth advocacy in politics. Due to COVID-19, we launched Masks for Medics, an initiative to confront PPE shortages affecting American healthcare workers. Ask us anything!","Hey r/Coronavirus! We are the five Directors of the Young Americans Coalition for Unity (YACU), a bipartisan nonprofit dedicated to getting young people engaged in politics and their communities. We recently launched Masks for Medics (M4M), an initiative to get medical masks into the hands of doctors who need them most during this pandemic.

In light of COVID-19 affecting the U.S. in unprecedented ways, we felt that we should all contribute to this ongoing fight. As our first major project, Masks for Medics launched earlier this week to combat the severe shortage of masks plaguing the American healthcare system. M4M fulfills an important need during this time by creating a centralized organization that provides a simple process for people to donate any spare PPE they may have to offer. In addition to donating, you can volunteer to help transfer these supplies to local hospitals in your community.

We’re not asking for money, just donations of masks you may already have at home. We also encourage volunteers to make PPE with cloth or 3D printing for further donations. You can start donating masks, volunteering, and requesting supplies (if you’re a doctor or hospital representative) on our website [here](https://masks.yacu.org)! We’d love to answer any questions about the donation process, how young people can lead their communities (especially in times like these), or anything else. We will be answering questions until **5pm EST**, but we will also drop back in with further answers later on.

g373we,Coronavirus,We're technologists at the ACLU. Ask us anything about recent proposals for tech-assisted contact tracing for COVID-19,"5:11pm ET update: That's a wrap from us! Thanks for your questions.
-----------------------------------
You may have heard of recently announced contact tracing efforts, including a joint [proposal](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/apple-and-google-announced-a-coronavirus-tracking-system-how-worried-should-we-be/) by Apple and Google, that would use Bluetooth technology to help alert people who have been in close proximity to someone testing positive for COVID-19.
 
We just released a new [white paper](https://www.aclu.org/report/aclu-white-paper-principles-technology-assisted-contact-tracing) outlining a set of technology principles against which developers, policymakers, and the public can judge any contract tracing apps and protocols.
 
Questions? We'll be here at 3pm ET with answers.
 
I’m Daniel Kahn Gillmor, u/dkg0, a staff technologist at the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. I work at the intersection of civil rights, civil liberties, and information technology. I work with lawyers and activists to help them make technically-relevant and feasible arguments and proposals for positive social change. And I work with engineers and designers to help them make technical decisions that protect civil rights and civil liberties by design. I'm a free software developer, a contributor to the Debian operating system, and a participant in standards bodies like the IETF. I have been active in discussions around tech-assisted contact tracing to help mitigate COVID-19, including the PACT group at MIT and the European initiative DP^3T. [Proof](https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1251138844591665153)
 
And I’m Jon Callas, u/joncallas, a senior technology fellow with the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. I work on issues surrounding encryption, forensics, machine learning, and surveillance with the lawyers and activists here. I also work on security and privacy standards to make sure they support civil liberties. In my past I was a co-founder of PGP, Silent Circle, and Blackphone. I've also worked at Apple on security audits and encryption. Apropos of this AMA, I have been working with groups doing proximity-based contact tracing to fight COVID-19 and was a contributor to the MIT PACT spec.

g2gofb,Coronavirus,"I'm Dr. Nuria Oliver, co-founder of ELLIS, the European Laboratory of Learning and Intelligent Systems. Let's talk about how AI/data science can help in the battle against COVID-19","Hi, I'm Dr. Nuria Oliver, and I was recently appointed Commissioner for AI and COVID-19 at the Valencian Government. I am also Chief Data Scientist at Data-Pop Alliance, Chief Scientific Advisor to the Vodafone Institute and co-founder of ELLIS ([https://ellis.eu](https://ellis.eu/)).

By training, I am a Telecommunications Engineer from the Polytechnic University of Madrid and have a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I firmly believe in the value of technology to improve the quality of life of people, both individually and collectively

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I have been working on using Data Science to help the Government of the Valencian region in Spain make better decisions based on evidence ([https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/ai-decoded/politico-ai-decoded-how-ai-is-helping-fight-a-pandemic-europes-coronavirus-app-insights-from-valencia/](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/ai-decoded/politico-ai-decoded-how-ai-is-helping-fight-a-pandemic-europes-coronavirus-app-insights-from-valencia/)). We have created a Data Science taskforce --composed of \~25 data scientists, a member of the Valencian Region President's office and the Data Protection Officer, working together on three large topics: (1) human mobility analysis and visualization; (2) epidemiological models; and (3) additional models. 

One of the projects that we have recently launched is the covid19impactsurvey to collect citizens’ data about their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can help us out by filling out the survey here (https://covid19impactsurvey.org). It's become one of the world's largest citizen surveys with over 180,000 answers. It's an inspiring example of collaboration between citizens, experts and the public sector. We have published early results of the analysis here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01014](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01014)

I'm here to answer questions about how AI and Data Science are helping fight COVID-19, about creating data science teams within governments, about the use of Big Data for Social Good, about what we are thinking of doing now that we are entering the control phase of the pandemic...or anything else about Data Science to model human behavior",76,/r/Coronavirus/comments/g2gofb/im_dr_nuria_oliver_cofounder_of_ellis_the/
