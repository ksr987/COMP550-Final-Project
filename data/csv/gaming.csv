I thought I was out of luck, they were going to change my email, hack my email - panic set in ngl. They added their PlayStation account again, but this time it was a different name? Removed it, changed the password, changed my email password, changed my Microsoft password - they are all different now. 

However, I feel like I can't just let them get away with it, is there anything I can do? I have emailed Epic Games to tell them what happened but I don't have much hope for them.

fu0tgt,gaming,Current Problem with Game Reviews (Resident Evil 3),"I have gotten a copy of Resident evil 3 and have already beaten it in less than 6 hours. While it was an awesome experience, I don't believe its worth it. It made me think about the current state of game pricing and reviewing. I hope you all understand that this is simply my opinion and I will respect others opinions. 

**There will be** **no spoilers for Resident Evil 3/2.**

&amp;#x200B;

The current issue with game pricing and reviews is that none of them account for ""length"" of the games. There are some amazing games that are certainly not cost efficient, while there are some absolute dog shit games that can take thousands of hours to fully complete for an average player. I consider Resident Evil 2 Remake to be one of the greatest games of this decade, which is my opinion and is not relevant to the discussion. I was one of those people who preordered  the game and paid full price for it. I was not aware of the short length of the game. While I think it is the best game of 2019, I would absolutely not pay full price for it if I can do it all over again. 

**Games that are short and amazing are as worthwhile as dogshit games that are extremely long.** 

I believe that the model best suited for game pricing should be based on:

 (hours of entertainment/price)\*review score

\-the hours of entertainment is the average time the game takes to 'finish' or in the case of infinite games, how long the user takes to lose interest on average.

\-the price is msrp pricing at the current time. 

\-review score is the score that the reviewing agency gives the game(ign, gamespot etc.)

This should be the score that review companies provide you with. It's a more honest approach especially in the modern day where people have a very limited budget.  Now sure the company can also give you the score out of a hundred or ten or whatever system they use, but this gives a much more truthful interpretation of what the product is. 

I have seen thousands of reviews for games in my life. Half of the time the reviewer will not mention play time, the other half will. The review score at the end almost always never accounts for time to beat. It's always an afterthought where in reality it decides how long you can enjoy this product. 

End of rant. 

tl:dr 

Game reviews should account for how long games are and how much they cost. These factors should be significant in game reviews.",9,/r/gaming/comments/fu0tgt/current_problem_with_game_reviews_resident_evil_3/

fum8b3,gaming,Jade Empire is an experience unlike any other game.,"Hello! I'm completely bored out of my mind and I've decided to start writing random articles about hidden gems or underrated games for the five random people that might stumble across this but hey it's something to do. So here's some reading material hope you like it.

Jade Empire was released in 2005 from the highly respected company BioWare... before EA got to them. This was published by Microsoft Games as an Xbox Original exclusive title however the game didn't exactly sell very well which is why they released it for PC in 2007 which was published by 2K. I believe the game sold around 500,000 copies which was was no where near what it should have sold. The reason it suffered in sales was largely due to the fact it was released right before the Xbox 360 hit the shelves. So this game completely went under the radar of most people as they waited for the new generation of consoles to arrive. However if you have Xbox One it's available under Backwards Compatible games. Jade Empire is an RPG action adventure with dialog options and large areas to explore giving it the feeling of being open world. Taking place in what looks like the Song Dynasty era, the game is centered around Chinese Mythology and martial arts.

You can select from a few choices of characters and pick from a wide variety of fighting styles. As you progress through the game you'll come across even more powerful fighting styles that you can level up. The leveling system and character creation is rather primitive however it's the combat and story that really shine. Many different fighting styles can be combined to create different styles of combat as well as harmonious combo attacks that completely obliterate your enemies. From hand to hand combat styles, weapons, status effect styles like the perfectly balanced Storm Dragon that can paralyze foes while Chi can be used to cast longer ranged magic attacks. Some of these fighting styles are directly tied in with your character alignment. As with many BioWare games you have dialog options and choices that allow you to be a peaceful loving Monk who follows the Way of Open Palm or you can be an absolutely murderous evil psycho path who chooses to follow the Way of Closed Fist. I swear some of the choices are very dark and often leave me thinking about the ramifications of those actions after you leave behind a trail of corpses and grieving family members... yes it gets that dark if you so choose.

The story is mesmerizing with how detailed the lore of the world is. The pure rush of nostalgia from hearing the voice actors of my favorite characters met along the way is something I truly cherish. Which has a surprising cast of voice actors from John Cleese to even Brian Doyle-Murray! You play a martial arts student learning under Master Li. As to not spoil anything given this is a BioWare game, meaning the best part of the game is the story, I'll just say your master gets captured by Emperor Sun Hai's forces. It's up to you to save him and along the way you'll come across a massive amount of different companions and followers who will aid you on your journey. Or throw bottles of alcohol at you during battle so you can preform the legendary Drunken Master fighting style. Yes that's a real thing. Some characters can be a bit one dimensional but many of them have extensive backstories and all have their own agendas. Depending on how you treat them you can befriend them, or be a little more than friends if you catch my drift, where they'll open up to you more. They might tell you their deepest secrets or stories. I'll never get tired of Black Whirlwind bragging about the time he stormed an Imperial Fortress by himself completely drunk and naked.

The game has a steady amount of side quest however not overly abundant. Which is great because I can't remember a single boring side quest in the entire game. Every single one has a deep story behind them and often are very rewarding to complete. At the very least even the lesser side quest offer a good laugh. Exploring side quests and areas are also very rewarding as far as loot goes. While the game doesn't have extensive customization like armor, you are equipped with a Spirit Amulet which you can fill with special gems that boost either combat skills or your ability to persuade, intimidate or intuition your way around dialog. Making sure you have a good setup of spirit gems is crucial. The game definitely gives plenty of challenges which really makes the combat that much better as you're constantly switching to status effects, weapons and Chi styles like Spirit Thief which drains Chi that you can use to heal yourself. Spirit Thief, Storm Dragon, Crimson Tears and Legendary Strike are some of my favorites. Leaping Tiger and Staves however provide much better range but that's the joy of the game, finding the styles that fit you.

Going back and playing older games for most people is not too easy on the eyes. Some of the games made during that awkward phase in between 3D polygon graphics of N64 and the attempts to make realistic looking 3D graphics on the Xbox Original have not aged well at all. Even one of my favorite games of all time, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, while I love that game the graphics aged like fine milk. Yet when I returned to Jade Empire I'm pleasantly surprised to see the graphics still hold up pretty well considering it's an Xbox Original game. I remember when Jade Empire first came out it was breath taking to see a non-linear game with such impressive graphics. It's not an open world exactly, it's more like open area where you have large areas with side quest and exploration that progress to a new area once you've completed the story mission there. Much like Witcher 2. The areas are so fun to explore around for side quest and each area gets better every time you progress. By far the best area though is the Imperial City, with endless amounts of fun things to do there including the fighting arena. Which has to be the best fighting arena in a game I've ever seen. It's not just a place to go to fight people, no no no. It has an incredibly long storyline with twist and turns throughout the quest. I believe it's completely optional too which is weird considering how in depth the story is. But you don't want to skip it.

It's unreal how this game ended up being a hidden gem given the production and amount of time that went into making it. While sure it could use a bit more polish and there are few complaints regarding the lack of customization that you'd see in other RPGs. The combat, story, colorful cast of characters, beautiful immersive environments, wonderful graphics and charm this game has just feels like it should have been a blockbuster game title. The game is just so massively different from other games. How many RPG martial arts games are out there exactly? I don't think we'll ever see a game quite like this one. Unless they do a sequel which they did tease at one point but unfortunately was canceled. Sadly not many know this game even exist. Which is why I highly recommend to give it a try for yourself.",9,/r/gaming/comments/fum8b3/jade_empire_is_an_experience_unlike_any_other_game/

fw1rq7,gaming,Help with picking a game to play on a new gaming laptop; I have a kind of a gaming burnout and don't know what to play anymore.,"I had a notebook with integrated graphics for 7 years and an old gaming PC that I upgraded back in 2011 to play BF3. 

So I didn't have the chance to experience big games like Witcher 3 or Metro Exodus, but I was able to play my favorite Dark Souls (the PC could handle DS1, DS3 and even Sekiro).

Now, I am a part time indie game developer and I work in computer security, so I am very critical and picky, and especially of new games and as you can judge from the Dark Souls, I like a challenge, but I dislike handholding.

I bought a gaming laptop (Y540) a week ago and couldn't wait to finally play games like Metro Exodus and Witcher 3... but both of them seriously disappointed me and I returned both of them. Exodus treated me like an idiot and had unskippable cutscenes and the dialogue was just horrible and Witcher was just not my kind of game, I got too used to Dark Souls style. I mean, it was interrupting my gameplay with tutorial on how to use items in the middle of the griffin fight! I had to end it there.

So, I need your help with picking a game that could invigorate my taste again? Or maybe I am just getting old? Or just too cynical? 

My absolutely favorite games are Dark Souls 1, Stalker (also Misery 2.0), Fallout New Vegas (NOT F4), Inside, Limbo, Super Meat Boy, Half Life 2, Hotline Miami, Binding of Isaac and of course old classics like Assassins Creed 2: Revelations (NOT the new ones after AC3) and Dishonored 1. I have spent hundreds of hours in BF3 and the original COD4. I tried some souls-likes like Hollow Knight, but I couldn't get myself to play more than half an hour, it started to bore me; just a dark souls ripoff with OST ripped off from Interstellar. And Sekiro just felt like work, who wants that after a long day?  

I got red dead redemption 2 for free as a gift with the new notebook, but I didn't really like GTA V, played through it once and never went back, same as with Dark Souls 3 or even Skyrim. And wild west is not really for me. But then again, I prefer open world games with no handholding, which RD2 could provide. I even tried to play The Witness as a challenge, but putting 60 hours into a game that has no meaning and tries to be philosophical but fails to do so as the author is just a post-modern poser.

It's dark, I have no fire or shelter, and I fell off a natural log bridge into a river and swam until I found a place on the shore to huddle up on. There's dense, pitch black forest on my left and  equally dark water on my right. There are snakes everywhere and I swear I keep hearing footsteps. There's some kind of animal screaming in the distance. I'm close to making a similar noise.

Edit; gave it a couple of tries, still getting used to stuff. Not sure what my first priority should be. Food or shelter? Probably food, since my guy apparently eats like a beast and goes insane after a few hours without a snack. Oh, and I'm not sure what to do about water.

fxog3b,gaming,Looking for a game like the 2006 Call of Duty 3 (speaking of multiplayer specifically),"The things I was particularly fond of in Call of Duty 3:

1. The open map style of the maps. Eder Dam, for example, was open with elevation changes, trucks, motorcycles, and plenty of room for all types of gun play. Poisson also had similar features, including trucks, motorcycles, and even tanks. The map was very diverse with plenty of room to move around and have different types of fighting.
2. Vehicles. The trucks with mounted MGs, the motorcycles with side cars, and the 2 different types of tanks you could drive made fighting and playing with friends extremely fun, especially when you would run them over.
3. The WWII style gun play. The maps were diverse enough for different types of fighting (shotguns, snipers, full auto rifles, etc.) and the WWII aspect of the game was appealing, but not necessary if another game has all the other aspects.
4. It doesn't feel like all the other Call of Duty multiplayers. I started to notice a lot of differences between Call of Duty 3 and Black Ops 3 after playing quite a bit of both. I don't mean this in the sense of graphics and glitches, just the style of the game is completely different and the Black Ops 3 maps feels like it is more geared to aggressive sniping than passive sniping. In Call of Duty 3 you could lay down in some grass and snipe people and they could only find you if they actually saw you, but in Black Ops 3 it so much easier to counter snipers with UAVs and such.

Also, I recently got Call of Duty WWII and I had very high hopes for it to be very similar to Call of Duty 3, but the only similarities I have seen so far are the WWII aspect of it. I have played only 1 online match (a team death match) and it felt just like Black Ops 3 but with older guns. There was no place to lie down and snipe across the map, no vehicles to drive, and it just didn't have the same flavor as Call of Duty 3. Maybe there is a different type of match I should play but I haven't found that out yet. The closest I have felt a game has come to the style of Call of Duty 3 was Battlefield 1 that was WWI oriented. The open maps, room to snipe, and plethora of vehicles brought back a certain sense of nostalgia that was beautiful and this might be the only game that can fill my particular wants for a game.

&amp;#x200B;

fy37b9,gaming,"Father of 2, considering another console after years of PC. Do I buy this gen or next gen?","Hi all. So I've been an avid, but not 'hardcore' gamer most of my life. From NES, to the XBOX, and 360. But after having two kids (7 &amp; 3) I found my time limited, so focused on PC games. I'm in software so already had to keep my PC updated, and with limited time for games buying a $400 console just seemed...financially unwise.

Well dusted off the XBOX 360 for my 7yr old son for quarantine and he's enjoying it. He also is pretty good at Overwatch on the PC.

So now that I'm financially stable and my son seems to enjoy games and playing together. The question is do I save the money and buy this gen, or go with next gen?

I really liked XBOX &amp; 360, but FF7 is one of my favorite games and last of us looked interesting. 

Games I've enjoyed most:
Bioshock
FF7
Starcraft
Overwatch
Fallout (really like 3 &amp; 4. New Vegas was ok. 76 disappointment)

Story telling is my big sell. Never big into shooters (excluding overwatch). My son will probably play more than me, but I'd like something we can both enjoy for when I do have time.",9,/r/gaming/comments/fy37b9/father_of_2_considering_another_console_after/

fykd99,gaming,What has the better story: Assassin's Creed II or GTA IV?,"Hi guys, I'm a senior in high school and my senior year is kind of getting fucked over. I figure now is the perfect time to return to my childhood love; video games

I haven't played video games on any serious level in about three years, and I haven't played these specific games since middle school. In truth I've never played the stories through on either game, I just got a few missions in and went to free roam. That's why I'm not revisiting GTAV or AC4: Black Flag. Those two 2013 titles basically defined my middle school years. They're great but too familiar for it to be a new experience.

I've singled these two games out because they seem to be the most well liked for story/plot in their respective series'. GTA 4 is dark, gritty, character driven and AC2 spawned an entire trilogy so it has to be good right?

Now, what should I play first? I'm leaning AC2 since I've always preferred AC gameplay and game mechanics, but I'm afraid that if I get really invested in Ezio's story I'll jump right into Brotherhood, Revelations and never return to GTA 4.

To people who have played both, which did you enjoy more for its plot, characters, humor, feelings/character connections etc? I know these games are ancient but no spoilers please and thank you :)",9,/r/gaming/comments/fykd99/what_has_the_better_story_assassins_creed_ii_or/

g05g5h,gaming,Controllers why are they still in one piece?,"Just a quick pitch to anyone who's listening.

Seeing how we debate the PS5 Controller and especially undocking the switch-controllers but just playing a game solo with one part in each hand made me think: why do we still use one small controller for both hands?

When I think about computer gaming: nobody uses the mouse and keys that close together. In fact the wasd-formation is as far away from the mouse as the keyboard goes. This is quite nice.

So obviously in the beginning of gaming there were wires and it'd have been bothersome to create separate controllers.

Today it's all wireless, so this doesn't count at all. We have the ability to store enough energy for hours of gameplay in small spaces and technology has become tiny compared to back then.

I guess the controller is small and in one piece because of historical (and back then technical) reasons.

So I imagine ergonomically shaped controllers   That fit each hand nicely. Middle and index fingers controll triggers. Joysticks at the thumbs. Buttons towards the palms. But most of all the hands and controllers can rest on the armrest or the thighs comfortably.

Now as i said I tried this with the switch-controller(s) and at first you don't know where to put your hands. But soon you get used to it and it's very liberating. Keep in mind that they are not at all shaped to be used like that so it feels a bit weird in the hand. But it works great. 

**TL:DR I guess the controller is small and in one piece because of historical (and back then technical) reasons.

g0hjaw,gaming,Going back to AC IV- Black Flag after Breath of the Wild,"Assassin's Creed IV-Black Flag is one of my favourite games of all time, period. I've purchased it on nearly every console I've owned. I first got it on my Xbox 360, PC and later on PS4 as well. So it's recent re-release on the Switch provides a perfect opportunity for me to jump back in and see how it has held up in the 7 years since its initial release.
But there's a caveat. In the time since my last playthrough, I've played another massive open world game with an emphasis on exploration, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. When I first played BotW, I claimed that it has ruined all other open world games for me. And nowhere is this more apparent that Ubisoft's 2013 sandbox.
Without further ado, let's start the comparison-
1) The first thing that I noticed in my playththrough of black flag is how dodgily it controls. Even basic actions like walking and climbing feel clunky and imprecise. This is not an issue for the most part since the game is almost insultingly easy, which brings us to point number two.
2) The weapon upgrades are practically useless. I went through the story without ever needing to change my starting guns and swords and I never felt at a disadvantage. The combat fails to be challenging even in some late game missions when you're supposed to be fighting like 20 guys at a time. It's flashy enough to remain engaging nonetheless, but I would have appreciated a slight challenge.
3) The world design is not intuitive at all. The missions are designed in a way that you are required to look at the mini map for instructions, which is one of the biggest detractors from immersion in the game world.
4) Story missions are too linear. Considering that this is an open world game, there is a distinct lack of openness in the game's missions. The moment you enter a story beat, you lose all freedom and have to follow a rigidly determined path. Often times, I found myself disappointed at how many structures in the environment looked perfectly climbable but were not.

The game truly opens up after you unlock the ship (and do a bunch of linear missions anyway). Atleast the primary loop of sailing the open seas, plundering ships and listening to shanties is still fun. That's about the only thing that holds up for me. Otherwise, this game has been completely annihilated by BotW.",9,/r/gaming/comments/g0hjaw/going_back_to_ac_iv_black_flag_after_breath_of/

There is also a scene where you have to try and save these virgins trapped on a set of poles in a ritual setup, but the ""sacrifices"" end up turning into the same weird tadpole kinda monster and you have to kill them all..

g1fkmy,gaming,The untapped potential of cloud gaming,"  

We are about to enter into a new age of gaming. With the release of the Xbox series x and the Playstation 5 the industry will be entering into a new generation of console gaming. Back in the early 2010’s industry analysis and companies were predicting the doom of the traditional console and the rise of mobile gaming. This created a conservative mindset within the industry and from analysis towards the then-upcoming 8th generation of home consoles. The result of this was both Sony and Microsoft using cheaper and underpowered AMD jaguar Apus that were designed for laptops. But as the 2010’s went on people started to realize the doom and alarm about mobile was overblown in most aspects and Sony and Microsoft then had the confidence to go full in on the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X with specs that make high powered PC’s bluff. But there is another aspect of both consoles that could change the name of the game for the upcoming 9th generations of consoles that many have written off as gimmick and unessacary… cloud gaming.

When Google Stadia came out with its big fart of a lanch people began to write off cloud gaming as a whole. As Google and Stadia were mercilessly beaten by public perception people forgot that cloud gaming had more to offer. In comparison, other cloud gaming services such as Geforce Now, PlayStation Now, and especially Xbox’s Xcloud have performed well. Instead of taking Google’s all-in approach these services in one way or another have presented themselves not as a replacement to local gaming but as compliments to it. But even then consumers at large still associate cloud gaming with Google stupia. But there is much more potential that especially Xbox and Playstation could do that could elevate cloud gaming as a must-have feature and service going forward in gaming. 

Imagine you just bought a brand new game and you can’t wait to play it. But then you see that dreaded downloading/ install screen. This happens to basically every gamer in the world and has been a part of gaming for the better part of the 8th generation of consoles and PC’s as a whole. But cloud gaming could change this. Imagine back to the old days of 360 and Ps3 where you could jump right into a game the moment you inserted the disc. Cloud gaming could bring this back. Think of how much of a convenience being to instantly play games again would be. While the game downloads in the background you could start playing instantly. No more download/ install times to keep us from playing our games. Another thing cloud gaming could change forever is game demos. When you are scrolling through demos/ games on an online store you have to download and wait for the game to be ready to play, but with cloud gaming, this could be instant. Imagine when using Xbox game pass and trying game demos with the ability to instantly play/ try anything that you see just like Netflix. 

Long download/ install times have been a bottleneck in the games that have been annoying for most gamers and that shows no time of stopping with the ever-increasing download/ install sizes of games today. But with the ability to instantly start and play a game with cloud gaming while it downloads in the background would be something that I think that most gamers would kill for. Companies that offer cloud gaming services should take note and not box themselves into simply just allowing people to play their games on their smartphones but instead widen the horizons to try and kill more problems with one stick. No matter the amount of fast SSD’s will solve this problem and cloud gaming could be the solution.

3) Something linear - I really don’t like open world. I really want a clear story that focuses me. I don’t do well with games like Breath of the Wild or Fallout. 

4) Something with a fantasy element.

5) Prefer turn based combat or something slower. Didn’t really enjoy Final Fantasy 15.

The Divison and Destiny I considered to be decent on launch, but No Man's Sky and Battlefront 2 is where I get hung up. Just to clarify, if a game wasn't that good and they patched it enough to make it good (Final Fantasy Online) then I can accept that type of comeback.

g278ff,gaming,PSA: You can now download 4 free games on your PS4. PlayStation+ is &gt;NOT&lt; required. Part of Sony’s Play@Home initiative for COVID-19.,"From right now (~25 minutes ago) until May 5th you can get the first 3 Uncharted games (the Nathan Drake Collection) and Journey for free from the PlayStation store.  Sony is doing this for free to support gamers worldwide dealing with COVID-19. 

Just go to the PlayStation store and search for the games. They will be/are currently listed as free. 

They are also following requests to limit bandwidth allocation so some networks in the world don’t get overloaded, so the downloads may take longer than normal — but hey you’ve got 3 weeks to get the games. 

(If you do have PlayStation+, you can also get the 4th and final Uncharted game for free as well. This was simply part of the free Plus games this month and isn’t part of the stay at home support stuff.) 

You can read the announcement here: https://blog.us.playstation.com/2020/04/14/announcing-the-play-at-home-initiative/

This is very cool of them and these are great games to play if you haven’t, or to replay if you have!! 

Curious to see if Microsoft, Nintendo, and others in the PC world follow suite in any way.  But this is cool regardless!

Play on my fellow gamers of the world! Stay safe!",9,/r/gaming/comments/g278ff/psa_you_can_now_download_4_free_games_on_your_ps4/

I'd like to get a more recent Civ game thanks to my stimulus cash, I think I'd fall in love all over again. What's a good jump from Civ III while not sacrificing on graphics? Should I go for VI?

g2nlt7,gaming,Which The Elder Scrolls like game is this?,"To be more specific it has Skyrim like gameplay. I believe it's from early or mid 2000s.  I remember the character name was ""Ragnarok""(Or something similar), had long and blonde hair(at least in my case, but I am not sure if I had the option to choose a different hair style and color).

As far as I remember the story goes like this: You first start off in a village where at some point you will need to pick a weapon and fight one of the guards(I think the fight takes place inside of a building). After you defeat the guard you will be taken on board on a ship. Then you will be shown a cutscene of a storm hitting and destroying the ship. After this the gameplay continues as you wake up underwater and everyone who was on board is dead and their dead bodies are just sinking underwater and you need to swim to the surface. After you swim up to the surface( as far as I remember, I am not 100% sure about it, cause my memory is blurry on this one) you will end up on a breach that is located in some sort of a cave(you still see the sky) and it's in a circle(similar to the Mexico marieta islands hidden beach, google it if you want to get a better picture of what I'm trying to explain). I remember quite clear that when you get on the ground you will encounter some sea creatures like crabs that you will need to fight. I also think(again, a blurry memory) that in the middle of the beach you will find the remains of the ship and I think you will need to go underwater one more time to search for something inside the ship. That's where my memories of the beginning of this game end.

Later in the game I remember that you will be able to equip you character with better equipment and you will be fighting people and monsters as well, but my memories on this game are quite blurry, because I played it quite a while ago. I think the part where I explained the beginning of the game will be just enough if you ever played it to recognize it.

In my library I have GTA V and the Arkham series that I haven’t played yet. I will get to GTA in the summer, and I didn’t really enjoy Arkham Asylum (hoping the other two are better). Right now, I have some money in my account, and I’m torn between getting TLOU, RDR2, Witcher 3 and AC Odyssey. Other games are welcome too! They all look pretty interesting to me.

g3w4c2,gaming,Kid-friendly two-player online birthday game,"Hi everyone,

I'm coming to you desperate for help.

I'm trying to organize an online birthday for my kid (9 years old) in this age of COVID-19.

We are doing a series of 1-on-1 online ""dates"" with each of the attendees. The concept is that they will each play my kid in a game, and we will give prizes to the kids with the highest score.

Here's what I need:

* Browser game (no app needed)
* Two-player online mode (each can play from their own computer)
* Easy match-making (via a code or invite link or something)
* No mature subject matter
* Ideally, less skill and more chance (so the non-gamers still think they are having a good time instead of just getting pwned)

I really don't play many browser games... do you have any ideas?

I was thinking of something like an online version of that old classic Scorched Earth or Worms or something. But I'm very open minded.

I've been looking for a couple of hours and I'm not much further ahead.

g4u0ap,gaming,If you have a console you're not using - sell it cheap on Craigslist or eBay or whatever platform is available to you. You never know who is going to buy it and how it will change their lives or the lives of their kids.,"About 6 years ago, I bought an x-box on Craigslist for my then middle school daughters. I couldn't afford to buy them a new one for Christmas, so this was the best I could do. The kid who sold it to me gave me an awesome deal. When we met to do the exchange, I saw that he was just a kid and his dad was with him (smart) for backup. The poor kid looked close to tears to say goodbye to his console, but his dad was letting him use the money toward a new one. My daughters cried y'all. They didn't care that it wasn't new - they were just so grateful. (The console came with controllers and I bought a couple of used games.)

Fast forward to now. My older daughter is now an avid gamer and it helps her with her anxiety and depression. She has social anxiety, so doesn't go out much, so gaming is her escape. Because she's so into gaming I've learned to love it myself so that I have a way to spend time with her now that she's moved out. It's even helping me with the anxieties of what's going on in the world. 

If you have a console you're not using - sell it cheap on Craigslist or eBay or whatever platform is available to you. You never know who is going to buy it and how it will change their lives or the lives of their kids.

g51dr9,gaming,I'm trying to remember the name of an old platforming game. Probably PS1 90s era.,"**Solved** Skullmonkeys is the name!

All I remember of it is that it was a really janky platforming game with sort of a similar vibe to earthworm Jim.

I remember at one point theres a claymation cut scene where the character you play (which looked sort of like the peperami guy from those adverts, or like a manic chicken man or something) aggresively ate a tin of beans and farted a green cloud out of the top of his head, which then became a new ability for the next section.

Me and my mate just stumbled upon the memory of renting this from blockbusters when we were about 9 or 10 and were blown away by how mental the whole thing seemed.

I've googled like crazy trying to figure out what this game was called but can't find a reference to it anywhere.

I'm asking this because so many other, more modern shooters featured that type of gameplay, themselves.  That is, in, say, Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, Battlefield, the Tom Clancy games, etc., submachine guns made you faster but weaker, light machine guns made you slower but stronger, and assault rifles are in-between the SMG's light weight and the LMG's heavy weight.",9,/r/gaming/comments/g5d1po/wolfenstein_3d_and_doom_weapon_question/

g5yl39,gaming,Involuntary impulse pressing of the R3 button is a curse and it needs a cure,"I am sure we have all hit R3 accidentally from time to time, especially in FPS games when taken by surprise and trying to fire back quickly only to exert pressure on the Right analogue stick and invoke whatever action is assigned to that button such as melee attack and the lovely phrase ""panic knifing"".

The problem is that this involuntary impulse reaction becomes more frequent as you age and lose your fine motor controls.

It's plagued me for the last 5 years and has gotten worse to the point that any FPS is basically unplayable.

There are workarounds such as rebinding but your'e just swapping a big problem with smaller ones, it's not ideal and it's still disheartening that I have to rebind R3 to a directional arrow and call in my score streaks every time I get into a gun fight (Warzone) or hopping like bunny if I switch layouts.

I believe the L3 and R3 buttons were the worst design decision of the console age and whilst I accept defeat in the fact they won't ever go away, I wish developers were less reliant on it for core actions, and perhaps give users the option to rebind the button to do nothing.",9,/r/gaming/comments/g5yl39/involuntary_impulse_pressing_of_the_r3_button_is/

g62ulc,gaming,Console exclusives are only viewed as negative when you can't get a game you want.,"Honestly, console exclusives are such a net positive, it's hilarious to see everyone throwing a hissy fit because they don't get the game they want.

I don't have an Xbox, because there's not a damn thing Microsoft has put out on their console that I can't get elsewhere that interests me. Part of this is their harebrained scheme of all Xbox games on PC, but most of it is because their games are just boring to me. The one exception was Killer Instinct, before the aforementioned PC plan. 

But you didn't see me throw a hissy fit and whine about how exclusivity was cancer. I shrugged and went back to playing other games. If I want KI that bad, I'll buy an Xbox. You also don't see players getting mad the game on their exclusive isn't on the other. Because they got theirs, so who gives a shit. 

Exclusivity not only pushes the consoles to be their best and give the game devs the money to make better games, but they also result in better games over all, as devs aren't forced to make a game, and two ports. 

Mind, this doesn't apply to platform exclusivity, because there's no benefit. It COULD lead to better distribution fronts, but this isn't r/storefront. Platform exclusivity doesn't force Windows to make their systems easier to develop on, or to have more power to make better games.

TL;DR Do your research, determine what console tends to have more stuff you like, and exclusivity won't be an issue. Or, save your pennies, and get the console with exclusives you like as well.",9,/r/gaming/comments/g62ulc/console_exclusives_are_only_viewed_as_negative/

g69k4b,gaming,I’ve always enjoyed the first few levels of an RPG more than the rest. Anyone else feel the same?,"That feeling when you first set out for adventure and know that you only have a few tools to help you. I love that feeling! 

I definitely enjoy it more than the feeling I have closer to the end of a game where I’ve made many choices on talents, spells, attribute points and chosen just the right magical weapons and armor for my build. It’s not the same feeling at all, and it’s not as enjoyable as the feeling I have in the beginning of the game.

Two specific games come to mind, both very different from each other.

**The first example**

First is the feeling when you have made a fresh Dark Souls character. You know that choosing cleric over pyromancer changes things up massively the first few levels, since you won’t have any kind of offensive magic for a long time. You then make your way through the Undead Burg with your trust mace. A fantastic feeling.  It closer to the end of the game, when I can choose from a huge list spells from all school, and an abundance of weapons and armor, that feeling is gone.

**The second example**

The second game is World of Warcraft. God I loved the first 20 levels in that game. Heading out to explore Elwyn forest with my Paladin. A hammer, a chainmail and a handful of holy spells was all I had when I went down into the kobold mine to search for treasure.
Then a few levels later, I was ready for the Dead Mines. As a Paladin I took the role as dps and off heal. It was easy to know what each class could do and what they couldn’t do, because they only had a few spells/abilities. That feeling of exploring the unknown with a group of equally fresh adventurers, it was magical.

But by the time I reached max level, everything felt bland and the number of talents and choices really took away from the feeling of just being a Paladin with his hammer, seeking adventure.

**The question**

Do anyone else feel the same when playing RPGs?

Judging by how most RPGs are set up it seems like I’m the only one enjoying that, since all the games I’ve ever played become very different after the first few levels. Things start to blend together and the amount of choices make it feel like I’m losing touch with my original character in some weird way.",9,/r/gaming/comments/g69k4b/ive_always_enjoyed_the_first_few_levels_of_an_rpg/

With the new consoles around the corner (ish), cloud gaming starting to take off, mobile going strong (despite a lot of bad business practices in that field), PC gaming being as good as ever with Raytracing finally being a reality, it's easy to get lost in arguments about which platform is the best. With online communities both in game and about the games elsewhere we've gotten closer together and that naturally creates tensions and disagreements. 

Just keep in mind, no matter if the person on the other screen is teabagging you, spaw sniping, screaming bloody murder in chat or the reddit comments about that loot you got and not the other way around, platform fans splurting nonsense about your platform being the worst or whatever it may be, you may be different but you're both gamers.

*Yes:*

1) A meaningful story progression towards an end goal

2) making party with npcs

3) utilize strategies in combat

4) medieval look and feel (preferably but not a deal breaker)

*No:*

1) No turn-based combat. It feels like a board game or a card game to me. Nobody would patiently wait for the enemy to come up with a move in a fight. This is the reason I couldn't get into Divinity Original Sin 2.

2) No pointless dungeon clearing just to get levels or items. I want to play to achieve an end goal.

3) No mindlessly spawning abilities to win

4) No shooting games.

g7511l,gaming,Samsung Q70R or RU8000 - for console gaming (PS5)," Planning to get new TV for gaming, pure console - I'm planning to get PS5 when its out. I believe that 4k\*60hz will be more enough for most of PS5 lifecycle. Watching  movies now and then, but really not snob about it. Not planning to connect it to PC.

&amp;#x200B;

 After going nuts on Rtings, I found 2 models that look good, and more or less affordable for me in my country (Israel). But can't decide what should I pick.

&amp;#x200B;

 \*\*Q70R\*\* \\- seems like best affordable QLED for gaming. No real shortcoming, most reviews say the image quality, colors, HDR and response are great. But its quite expensive - around 1135$ here.

&amp;#x200B;

 Before you mention alternatives - Sony and LG-OLED is stupidly expensive in Israel - 30-40% more.  

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 \*\*RU8000\*\* \\- looks like great gaming TV, with 120hz at 1440, great responsive times, and good enough colors for movies as well. And its much cheaper - 680$.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  So the question is - should I try harder and get better, perhaps more future-proof TV, or RU8000 is good enough and I can save the money?

g7is09,gaming,What's your take on face model based game characters?,"Hi, so basically i want to know what your thoughts are on video games characters as of late being based off real life model faces and motion captured by them. Does it remove the originality of the character? Is it lazy design choice?
For example, Capcom started using real life model faces on their games like in DMC and RE. Do you hate that now Jill is a real face? And that Nero from DMC 4 face changed in DMC 5 and if you do hate the new Nero how would you want his original DMC4 design to be translated into DMC5? Should've they kept the same design choice of DMC4 to avoid using face models? Did it lose its japanese video game aesthetic that most view when they think of Japanese video game they think of square enix's Final Fantasy?
Do you hate that more japanese games are using this style and would rather they stick to the design of NieR, Final fantasy, Persona and such?
And what's your arguments on people either hating or loving such design change?
My opinion : i honestly don't care, i love both DMC5 characters and Final Fantasy 7 remake characters. And I don't think that it's lousy or unoriginal to do so since we all know who Ellie was based on Allen page but it still is the Ellie we grew to love and care for. She is her own original character, and people will cosplay her as such, As well as i like Prompto from FFXV even tho he isn't based on a face model, and i love Nico from DMC5 since she feels alive and funny and i would love to cosplay all of them.",9,/r/gaming/comments/g7is09/whats_your_take_on_face_model_based_game/

g7n6ae,gaming,Smash Bros Ultimate Concept: Jonesy,"Here is a cool concept I had if a Fortnite character could be in Smash bros game!

Basic Stats:

Weight: The weight of the character would be mid-class around a 104 weight stat giving the Jonesy an average movement like in the game.

AirSpeed: Since you can't move fast in the air in Fortnite Jonesy would be a slow character in the air moving at a speed of about 900 in the air.

FallSpeed: In Fortnite, you fall pretty slow so we'll make the speed around 1,300.

Fast Fall: The fast fall would be slightly faster at 1,400 because in the game you can't fast fall.

Dash Speed: Since the running in Fortnite is average so is the dash, the speed is 1,950.

Running Speed: Running speed is average so it's 1,900.

Animations And Other Neat Things:

Walking: The old classic default walk that we all know and love.

Running: The classic run cycle and with the Og sound effect, we all know and love.

Dodge: This animation would be the same dodge animation when you dodge with the umbrella equipped.

Jump: The classic jump with the sound effect of course.

Double Jump: If you double jump you will pull out the chapter 2 default glider and as a plus, if you win the last game you played you will automatically have the winning umbrella equipped. This state gives you a floaty feel when activating it.  Also while it the glider state you cannot exit it until you are knocked back.

Air dodge: The dodge animation would be the free fall animation in Fortnite when you drop from the bus. 

FreeFall: This animation would be the one from the Season X trailer where Jonesy fell from that portal and hit the ground.

Tripping: When he trips he will do the flipping sexy emote.

Entrance: The butterfly rift opens up and Jonesy will appear with the classic sound and animation.

Swimming: This animation would be the one from chapter 2 of Fortnite.

Drowning: Since you cannot drown in Fortnite this animation would be you doing the deep dive emote stylishly when you fall with the emote music of course.

Dizzy: This will be the dance therapy emote but without the dancing only with the head holding part and it won't startup.

Sleeping: Since there is no sleeping emote we will compromise, we will take the bottle cap emote fail and it will keep you on the ground until you wake up.

Star K.O: When this happens you will activate the animation when in a choopa when it gets shot down.

Balance: It will be the overdrive emote with its emote music of course.  

No Contest: Jonesy will do his OG slow clap emote. 

Crowd Cheer: This will be the sound from the world cup emote with the catchy world cup theme with the occasional ""Jonesy!"" thrown in there.

Boxing Ring Description: ""The Building Champion""

Kirby Hat: The hat would be Jonesy's haircut with his tat on Kirby's right arm.\]

Down Taunt: The classic default dance with the catchy tune everyone loves.

Side Taunt: The floss with the music and if you hold down the taunt button it will go for as long as you hold it.

Up Taunt: The classic boogie-down emote with the nice music.

Idle: It would be Jonesy inspecting his Gold Ar with the inspect animation Fortnite has.

Victory Screen #1: Jonesy would do take the L with the classic music.

Victory Screen #2: Jonesy will 90 up until you cannot see him anymore with the default lobby music.

Victory Screen #3: Jonesy will grab a port a rift and will use it going back to his home and leaving a rift behind.

Palutena's Guidance: ""Palutena who is this guy?"" ""Pit, he was from Athena but now he currents resides in Apollo."" ""Don't be fooled by his ridiculous dances he can put up a fierce fight!"" ""Yeah, and he breaks the nature too I already don't like him."" ""He can build and keep you at range with his weaponry"" ""Ok so all I have to do is close the distance this s easy!""

Character Specific Animations: When you win you will see the victory royale logo pop up. All of his emotes have music.

Attacks: 

Jab: A one-two combo with his pickaxe and he finishes it with a well-aimed pump shot with a flashy 200 damage shot appearing, this is only cosmetic as it won't deal that much damage. 

Infinite Jab: Jonesy pulls out the Smg and does continuous fire with short-range sort of like inklings jab.

Side Tilt: Is a faster version of the point it out emote made to look like an attack.

Down Tilt: Jonesy hits a deep dab and makes the classic sound effect and the attack trips.

Up Tilt: The final hit of the turbocharged emote with the sound effect.

Neutral-Air:  A jumping pickaxe swing that is in a forward motion.

Foward-Air: A jump shot with a tac shotgun with a flashy 182 number showing up, will not do that much damage it is purely cosmetic. 

Back-Air:  A 180 flick shot with the flint knock, you only can do this once in the air since it will launch you and does a hefty amount of damage and it has a cooldown, also it will show a flashy 180 damage effect for a cosmetic look. Good for horizontal recovery.

Down-Air: Jonesy pulls out a bolt action sniper and shoots down. This move can spike, and if it hits it will display a 220 damage cosmetic number.

Up-Air: Jonesy does the Click emote and if it hits it will play the signature sound.

F-Smash: Jonesy will pull out the infinity blade and do an overhead smash, after the attack, he will put away the blade.

Down-Smash: Jonesy will pull out 2 RPGs and blast the floor around him. 

Up-Smash: Jonesy summons a port a fort that will immediately disappear after using it, this will need a solid floor to work.

Grab: Jonesy will place a pyramid and trap the user.

Jab: A zapper trap will fall from the sky and will land on the ground, since the jab takes longer, it will do way more damage than others.

F-Throw: Jonesy will peak the pyramid and then blast whoever is inside with a pump shotgun.

Back-Throw: A third party will come in with an RPG and blast whoever is inside with the explosive shot.

Up-Throw: A B.R.U.T.E will appear out of nowhere and launch whoever is inside with the explosion when it dropped at the end of Season X.

Down-Throw: Jonesy will throw a Junk rift and it will flatten whoever is in the pyramid.

Neutral-Special: A wall will be placed by Jonesy and will take about 50 damage before breaking it. It interferes with projectiles and melee attacks.

Side-Special: It will draw out your sniper and you can aim in any direction but you have to stay still during the attack, and to help aim you will get a laser sight on the gun to see where you are shooting.

Down-Special: An aimable impulse grenade, if anyone is hit by the nade it will send you about double jump distance, and if there is no floor below you nothing happens the nade just falls. 

Up-Special: It will spawn a launchpad much like sonic's spring, if you are Jonesy then it will put you in the glider state.

Final-Smash: A plane comes out of nowhere piloted by the cuddle team leader and the people on the wings are Tomato Head, Drift, Black Knight, and Fishstick, as they blast you with all of their firepower, and out of nowhere the Mech from Season 9 comes in and slashes everyone with the sword powered by the Zero Point.

Cosmetics:

Default: Jonesy's standard look for Chapter 2.

Alt 1: Bunker Jonesy from Season 9.

Alt 2: Jonesy's OG look from Chapter 1. Replaces weapons with older forms of themselves, such as the pump, bolt, RPG, and etc.

Default Color Change 1: Lt. Evergreen would fill up this slot because he is a basic change for Jonesy. 

Default Color Change 2: Slurp Jonesy, the effect also works in smash as it will detail your health based on your head.

Alt 1 Color Change 1: Blue color scheme based on the overtime challenges of that Season.

Alt 1 Color Change 2:  Jonesy will have a red and white color scheme based off of vendetta the season 9 tier 100 skin.

Alt 2 Color Change 1: Jonesy will have the Classic Skull Trooper outfit on.

Alt 2 Color Change 2: Jonesy will have Rex skin on.",9,/r/gaming/comments/g7n6ae/smash_bros_ultimate_concept_jonesy/

g8al6h,gaming,Looking for Good Multiplayer Games Similar to Sea of Thieves,"Hello everyone. I am looking for some game recommendations. Any help would be much appreciated!

I am looking for some new games similar to Sea of Thieves that I can play with my friends. Whether its 2 player co-op or a full 4 man squad doesn't matter. Also, I'm not asking about other pirate games specifically. I also am not looking for MMOs or Battle Royales. I want a game that is similar to SOT as far as the casual gameplay and the goal of getting richer (or more powerful) with your team. Basically a game with actual progression like SOT or Minecraft, rather than match based games like Fortnite where there is no real progression system.

As far as SOT, I like playing missions that are very extreme or crazy (like the megalodon, kraken, etc) that makes your whole squad running around like crazy trying to fight off the enemies while trying to keep each other alive. Now you might say that goes what I said earlier about looking for a ""casual game"". But what I mean is that I'm looking for games with PVE. I am not looking for PVP only games, as my friends and I are not very good at fighting other players. I also like there being an endgame as well, similar to SOT's Shores of Gold quest, or Minecraft's Ender Dragon battle.

Note:  I play on PC, and so do some of my friends. Some play on XBox One and PS4 though, so if you know any cross platform games, please let me know. Also, obviously free games are preferred, but they don't have to be. Let me know your game recommendations regardless of the price.

If anyone knows any good games like this, please let me know. Thank you in advance!",9,/r/gaming/comments/g8al6h/looking_for_good_multiplayer_games_similar_to_sea/

I used to play video games a lot when I was younger (back around 96 to 2004).  then life got busy and I kind of just stopped.  

I am finding that compared to other things I spend money on , video games these days offer hours of entertainment for pretty cheap.  I don't usually buy games as soon as they come out, I am ok waiting a year or 2 for them to get cheaper. 

since I am so out of the loop with what have been really good games in the past few years, I was hoping someone could recommend some games for me based on what I enjoyed.  

I loved the following games recently, in order of how much I liked them:

Spiderman
uncharted (played all 4)
the last of us
god of war

I didn't particularly like red dead redemption 2.  I found that you spent too much time riding a horse around, I just didn't have the patience for it.

I've always played the most fun and most obviously amazing choice of games, so I'm kinda used to it. My standards for games have been permanently molded to top of the line, super fun, so it's sort of like being desensitized when trying out new games. I can't enjoy less amazing games that much.

The best game I've had for a long while would be either Far Cry 5, or Just Cause 3 in the last few years.

But I can't find really find anything else, which is why I'm looking for suggestions.

fu1ii8,gaming,Why do you hate GameStop?,"Ever since I began playing video games, I always went to GameStop to buy new ones. It quickly became my new favorite store. My old favorite store was Toys R Us. Everything seemed fine, until i came to this subreddit. For some reason beyond my realm of understanding, everyone here has an irrational hate-boner for GameStop. Most people say “buy your games online”. There are many problems with that. First of all, long delivery times and shipping fees suck. Second of all, digital stores don’t sell actual real games, but just soulless data disguised as games. Third of all it’s this whole “buy it online” mindset that killed Toys R Us. I don’t want GameStop to suffer the same fate. Look I know their trade ins aren’t the best, but you people way too easily forget of the years of amazing gameplay they’ve given all of us. So I ask you, stop hating GameStop, stop buying soulless data and buy real games instead. Together we can save the only store for gamers.

There isn't one, I just think it's interesting.

The Wii U and PSVita flopped about as hard as one another, both failing to sell more than 15 million units. The 3DS did well, selling about 75 million units, the Switch is doing well selling about 52 million units and counting. The PS4 on the other hand has sold about 109 million units.

Obviously both companies have had their successes and failures. I think for a single console, the PS4 won, but for a handheld, Nintendo won, twice.

ft2v2z,gaming,Need help finding long lost video game,"Hello I'm looking for a videogame that scared the crap out of me when I was younger, but I was mesmerized by how cool it looked. My older cousin would play video games in his basement and my siblings and I would watch him play(He played on Xbox 360 and Ps2). I'll give you what I remember from a level. He was walking through white corridors and descended down a quite short staircase to find a scientist in a room. The scientist said some like ""Here you're gonna need this to get out of here alive"" and you would be handed some sort of laser weapon that the scientist created. Then during that cutscene something that was on the ceiling came down and ripped his head off. You had to kill that scary creature and then return to the halls to now fight this new type of creature you just encountered. 

I hope someone can help me identify this game. I will take any suggestions as to what it can be and I will go through them. If you can find gameplay of it I would appreciate it.

Anyway, I was thinking there would be no better place to ask than on here.

So my only memory:

It’s a 90s PC game, first person shooter I think. Male character. He’s walking up a narrow spiral staircase in a medieval-like tower. The music playing was what I remember most clearly and is what has given me this strong desire to track the game down. It was like that really old church or monk music. Like old men with deep voices signing in a cathedral or whatever so that you get this echo-ey sound.

That’s it. I know it’s a long shot but I thought I’d ask. It could be a game that I remember, just a scene that I don’t remember... I used to love playing duke nukem and doom so I thought maybe it was one of those games. Wolfenstein was another I played a bit.",8,/r/gaming/comments/fv4ifn/name_this_pc_game_from_the_90s/

2 - crafting skills that develop as you play - for example via unlocking skill trees and finding recipes/blueprints, over having everything available from the beginning

fv8xts,gaming,Looking for games,"I trying to find a game or few that I enjoy. I really like leveling systems In games, such as Skyrim, or ark. I’ve also really enjoyed Skyrim and ark, but I could never get far in Skyrim because I would always get lost in side quests, and get bored. I also never finished ark because there was way too much grinding. 

I also really enjoy first person open world games.

I’m fine with general grinding, if it’s not just the same stuff over and over, but ark grinding sucks, because a lot of time is spent just trying to build, and get resources to build, which I didn’t enjoy much. 

I also would enjoy it if it’s not too exploitable in some way. In Skyrim I would always grind out a perk, such as blacksmithing, then make dragon armor, then be pretty much invincible to everything for a while, and it would also ruin the game for me, which might just be something I need to figure out.

I’m not much interested in multiplayer either. If yes multiplayer where you can make parties, and work together, that kinda stuff, then I like that. But when the multiplayer where you fight each other, I don’t like it much, as I am not good at avoiding, and there’s always a level gap. I’m also not much interested in multiplayer because I don’t have anyone to play with, and am not good at making friends in real life or in games, usually I just like... follow people and hey eventually accept me.

I have a pc and Xbox one, so any games on there I can get. I don’t have game pass,but I do have gold, if that’s useful to know.

I really appreciate any suggestions you could give me!

fvnmdo,gaming,[rant] Something that bugs me about video game reviewers.,"So I watch tons of reviews, often for games I've already purchased, usually just because but sometimes it's to get a feel for other peoples reactions to a game after I've already solidified my own opinion.


Anyway I was watching a review for Animal Crossing when it hit me and it may only be relevant to animal crossing but it still bugs me for some reason. 

Here it is, during the reviews for animal crossing you see plain as day that they have been time skipping in order to speed up their game, sure lot's of people do it and it's not officially categorized as cheating, on top of that a reviewer is meant to pump that review out as fast as possible so of course they would do that it only makes sense right, but here's the thing, ACNH is designed in a way that it uses time to throttle progression and this is a fundamental design point, the entire game is based around this concept and as such it has a lot to do with the experience the user has while playing it, so If a reviewer did not have the intended or even average gameplay experience how can they possibly review said experience?


Nomatter your stance on time skipping in animal crossing the fact is it drastically changes the overall loop of the game, so in my eyes a time skipped review counts for nothing to a player who does not intend to timeskip.

Got a new Micro-USB cable from a phone charger laying around for my Xbox controller, and plugged that in. Now it no longer recognizes it at all.

fxszkz,gaming,Bought a game on g2a that is not valid in my country,"Guys, just wondering if anyone of you had some similar or the same situation as I have now.

I bought a game which I got with the loot points. I got a discount for a PES 2020 for 7 and something bucks. On the seller's page, there was saying that the game can be played in my country. After I bought it and tried to activate it on Steam, I got big nothing. First thing I contacted the seller but he didn't answer me after 7 days (from that moment I could use ""Money Back Guarantee""). Then I contacted the support and their reply was that I need to go to the police to report this fraud. I mean, cmon in this pandemic situation to go to the police, they would probably just kick me out. Is there any online global report that I can use?

I've had Sims 3 and 4(bloodsucking DLCs as well), and Overwatch(couldn't play after my kind of alright laptop broke, and I wouldn't want to play anything by Blizzard now anyways), but for the majority of my gaming life I have only been able to play the first two due to money restrictions; low graphics, low memory space, and they were priority due to how amazing they were. Due to recent events, not related to the pandemic, I now have enough money for a rig able to play some rather epic games. I do not care for graphics too much, however, I just want to know what ""classics"" or other awesome games I have missed out on. For reference, I prefer PC, but I have a Switch and PS4 as well. :)

Current games already on my to-get list:  
Cyberpunk(Keanu Reeves, plus the whole future-esque feel)

Doom Eternal(on PC, I think a year ago I watch Markiplier absolutely smash demons and I felt the desire to as well)

Animal Crossing(on Switch)

Dark Souls(I hear it's difficult, so I feel like it could be used for gaining ""gaming experience"", and has a lot of lore, and I LOVE lore)

Eve Online(free, but I'd like to hopefully get some opinions on it)

fyctbn,gaming,Happy Final Fantasy 7 Release day!,"When I was a young lad, I had quite a lot going on. I had been through a hell of a lot by the time I was 12 years old. So I ended up using video games as an escape.

In my darkest days I played Final Fantasy VII as distraction and escapism from what was going on in my life.

It may sound sad to the unitiated but being able to relate to the tiny pixelated characters on the screen meant so much to me back then that it stuck with me my whole life. 

So much so that I ended up studying game development and work in the games industry now. 

Today we see the release of the first part of the remake. A game that was so huge in size it is no wonder it would require a remake that is even larger.

I've waited a long time (10 years maybe?) for the technology to be ready for this gaming cultural touchstone. 

From the 5 hours ive played so far it is everything I needed and more added by the irony that it has released at a time when we all need a little escapism.

The story is more relevant now than ever.
The fight for change in our society is imminent.

To all my friends playing today I'd love to know what it means to you?

fygm49,gaming,Simplying the gaming experience,"I don't like how segmented I feel my gaming is between devices. Took stock today and I really don't think there is  a need for me to have a PC, PS4, Wii and Switch so I tried to think about how to reduce it but  I am not quite sure how to.

The PS4 I use to keep in touch with irl friends. Ideally they'd move to PC but it's not happening. My Switch is basically the travel device which I use quite a lot on longer train and plane journeys for work. The Wii is there because it seems like the only decent way to couch coop when people are over and my desktop I use for playing more solitary games or with friends I've had over the internet for years.

It's very easy for my to rationalise keeping one of each but I do think that I  want to cut down. I'm wondering how you guys manage keeping away from buying in each market sector and not end up justifying buying a console in each and then keeping up with each next gen release.

It really has some really crazy charecter by horror game standards, the gameplay is fine tho there is definitely scope for improvement,and with regards to a long franchise ala resident evil using morbius as a stand in for umbrella corps with a push in the proper direction can result in a really great game.

So, I was watching some Star Citizen videos and I started wondering if there is a game that has simple graphics (not a requirement, but it helps bulding a complex and vast game, I think), but is ambitious to a point where the developers idea was/is to have a lot of features, professions, items, things to do. It doesn't matter the thematics of it (space, medieval, idk).

I know some games are like that, but their scope and gameplay are limited (for exemple: it's just a survival game, or a rpg game).

One thing that would be nice is that there is a lot of comunnity participation, creating and submitting ideas/feedback to the project.

I remember that there was a pokémon fan game project from my country (br) a long time ago, and it was so much fun to follow the idea and development of it, but sadly it didn't exist anymore.

I may be asking for information of a utopical game, but it doesn't hurt to try.

Apex was good for the first 3 days I played it, then did not really enjoy it. Don't even get me started with Fortnite.

No, I'm not fanboying COD. I just love the gunplay in those games. If Blackout was F2P and came with consistent map updates, I think it would have been fire. Hopefully Warzone doesn't make the same mistake.

New here so if this isn't allowed in this sub, please call me out and I'll take it down :)

Basically, I play primarily Fortnite but also Apex, COD, and some other FPS on a controller on PC. I've always had an Xbox, so play on a Razer Wolverine Tournament Edition right now. Got it just over a year ago (adios warranty) and absolutely love it. The paddles on the back are great, and the extra bumpers are perfectly placed and seem to be something that only the Razer Wolverines have. Downsides to the controller -- sensitivity works a bit different from normal Xbox controllers and takes some getting used to, and as of this month my bumper seems to sometimes not work, and sometimes click twice. 

Now I need to make a massive decision. Do I buy the same controller again, upgrade to the Razer Wolverine Ultimate Edition, or move on to a Scuf or Elite 2? Only requirement for me is for the controller to be wired or have a wire to plug in. 

It seems like the extra bumper is the only thing keeping me on the Razers, but its a huge advantage over the other controllers. Let me know what your experiences have been with controllers and their durability, customizability, etc please. I've done some digging on blogs and other forums but they're all putting controllers from logitech and steam on par with Scuf so can't really trust any of that.",8,/r/gaming/comments/g332bj/deciding_on_a_new_controller_for_gaming_on_pc/
g34yxs,gaming,Questions Regarding PC Gaming On A HP Laptop,"Hello,

I recently have brought a hp laptop for school, but I was wondering if I could play games on it too. While setting a Microsoft account, I ended up browsing the available games. I do enjoy playing video-games, but I've mostly played them on a Wii, PlayStation System, a Gameboy, and from gaming sites like Newgrounds and Kongregate. I did try to find some articles regarding this on my own. However, I ended up seeing ones about gaming with a desktop computer which is only used for gaming, not for laptops used by students.

I hope for answers, tips, or articles regarding the following questions:

1. Can I play games on a Laptop? Like the ones for PC gaming in Mircosoft Store.
2. If so, what do I need to do besides downloading it? Like controllers, headsets, etc..
3. How does ""Xbox Console Companion""  or an Xbox play a roll in Hp Computer gaming? I came across it after  downloading Microsoft's casual games, it said making an Xbox account would help in securing my progress.
4. If I can download/play games on an HP Laptop which is also being used for school; What are the pros and cons?

Thank you for your time! I look forward to hearing a response.

Sincerely,

g3hzq7,gaming,(QUESTION) Are there any realistic Battle Royale games?,"Most BR games like Apex, have massive ttk, requiring 10-15 bullets to kill an enemy, which I think is insane.

So my question is, are there are BR games that have realistic damage/combat? Something closer to Squad or Battlefield on Hardcore? (where 2-3 bullets will kill a target consistently?)

I've only played Apex and PUBG (years ago and it was EXTREMELY buggy, not sure if PUBG has improved)

the last one is virtuoso RGB wireless. what I liked about this is the white color and it comes with a USB type c. according to the reviews, the sound is better on wired connect, like everything else duh.

g5rulg,gaming,New Frustrating Habit of Losing Interest In A Game After Dying A Couple of Times,"Let me start off by saying I have nothing against games with high difficulty; I grew up with Atari and NES. I beat Mega Man 1-3, Dark Souls twice, platinum-ed many games such as Witcher 3 and Catherine (almost) and World of Warcraft for a few years where death in raids are expected.

However, in the last two years I have been starting this trend where I completely lose interest in a game after dying a couple of times or wandering around too much due to being lost. I first noticed it with Sekiro, a game I was anticipating but put down the controller after dying too much (NEVER a problem in the past), and lost most of my interest in completing the game.  Sometimes I find myself turning down the difficulty in games (wait...what?). I quit Mega Man 11 downright altogether. As much as I didn't want to, this habit affected FFVII Remake for me as I turned down the difficulty halfway through the game.

My breaking point with this habit was Doom Eternal last week. I just finished putting 150 hours into Persona 5 and decided to transition into Doom Eternal, which is huge amounts of praise. I loved Doom (2016) and couldn't wait to see the carnage and listen to the awesome music. I started on Normal, and couldn't seem to get past a particular area after a dozen tries, so I turned the difficulty to easy. The game became unbearably uninteresting and monotonous. Of course, I turned the game off and the thought of it feels like a painful memory.

I will admit spending 150 hours on a game like Persona 5 where I only died 3 times is a big transition to Doom Eternal. But now I'm to the point where I'm browsing through my backlog and skipping games where I think I'm going to die too many times, like Resident Evil 3 Remake. And I LOVE Resident Evil. It's depressing.

Could this be considered a ""getting old"" thing? I turn 33 in a couple of months. Has this or is this happened to anyone else? Any suggestions?",8,/r/gaming/comments/g5rulg/new_frustrating_habit_of_losing_interest_in_a/

g7s5y1,gaming,Something I noticed in most first-person shooters as compared to most mecha games,"In first-person shooters, armor for small, squishy humans is not divided into different weight categories in much the same way as armor in medieval fantasy RPG's, because said armor is mostly just an extra set of HP.  But it's the *weapons* that are divided into different weight categories, instead, including lightweight weapons like pistols and submachine guns, heavyweight weapons like light machine guns and launchers, and medium-weight weapons like assault rifles.

Mecha, on the other hand, I don't think have their own equivalent of SMG's, AR's, and LMG's.  But they *are* instead divided into different armor categories as well as different weapon categories, including light armor for extra mobility, heavy armor for extra defense, and medium armor for a balance between mobility and defense, plus numerous melee and ranged weapons, as well.

And a perfect example I can think of that demonstrates those differences is the Titanfall series.  Human pilots can't equip themselves with different armor types like the Titans they pilot, especially since they have regenerating health, anyway.  Instead, it's their weapons that have different weight categories, including lightweight SMG's, medium weight assault rifles, and heavyweight LMG's.

g8a2z2,gaming,The struggle between fun and frustration. Gamebalancing as it applies to legend shooters and fighting games,"Planning to put out a video on the topic and im just trying to lay my thoughts out and get your opinion on this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good Game balance for fighting games and legend shooters depends not on character equality but on where characters lie on the fun vs frustration scale. A character should be as FUN as possible while being as frustrating as possible to deal with the point where the opposing player still continues to play. Balance in a traditional sense (balance toward equality) does not matter. Tweaking your games in this fashion leads to a hemonogy of playstyles(every character does generally the same thing), and In a game balanced like this players will often choose between the coolest looking character or the easiest. Game designers should instead make their characters as fun to play as possible and work to make it less frustrating to deal with. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*How can devs make things less frustrating?\* Game developers can achieve this by making strong characters more difficult to play. By giving stronger characters a higher skill ceiling and a steeper skill curve you ensure two things: skilled players are rewarded for honing their craft/labbing their character and average players deal with fully optimized strong characters less. A good example of this is Dudley in street fighter 4. He was an in-your-face upclose boxer with high damaging combos and ridiculous mixup potential. The only problem was his combos were incredibly hard to pull off. Requiring players to execute 2 and 3 frame links for the simplest of combos. This didn't even take into account this characters poor neutral. Dudley saw very little success in casual and even professional matches but there was one player whos execution was apt enough to pull off his combos consistently, and had repetitive success using him. If you look at teir lists for SSF4 Dudley sits comfortably at mid teir. Now every character doesnt has to have balancing this extreme but this is what should be kept in mind when balancing legends, not strength parity. Stronger characters should be harder to use while weaker characters should be eaiser and more beginner friendly. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Ok but what makes characters fun to play?\* just as video games have a target audience so should your characters. Game designers should design characters around PEOPLE not functions. Create a character you know your best friend would love to play. Do you have a friend who just loves to hold W and charge into battle? Make a character like Octane that gets a speed boost when he presses Q. Does your friend love playing mind games? Design a character with this in mind and no matter how weak a character is they will play them. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Doesnt how fun a character is depend on how good they are?\* No, not necessarily. Characters like elena in USF4, and Superman in injustice are some of the best characters in the game yet they are frustrating to play against and not fun to use. Why? Because they dont require the player to make interesting decisions. These characters have repetitive strings that limit the amout of possibilities on the battlefield, putting both players in the same situation constantly. This leads to stale and uninspired gameplay. Some characters however, have to be strong in order to be fun. If pathfinders (APEX) grapple ability didnt allow you to cover large amounts of distance he wouldnt be fun to use because players wouldnt be rewarded for optimizing grapple swings. Akuma (SSF4) has to be strong otherwise players wouldnt be rewarded for creating setplay. Mira (Killer Instinct) has to be strong be cause she requires an incredible amout of risk to play. This works the opposite way as well. Characters such as Zangief (SSF4) or Aganos (Killer Instinct) has to be tuned down because of how frustrating he is to play against. The best character in a fighting game can never be a grappler because the fun vs frustration matrix(?) Is skewed to be increasingly frustrating, just like the best character in a game can never be a tank. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: strength parity doesnt matter. Where your character lands on the Fun vs Frustration graph matters. Making characters that connect with a specific person matters. Fun doesnt always equal good, and good doesnt always equal fun.",8,/r/gaming/comments/g8a2z2/the_struggle_between_fun_and_frustration/

g8lyj1,gaming,An open world multiplayer game combined with Jurassic park franchise dinosaurs. Hear me out,"(M16) I know this may sound stupid, but for a couple years I've always had a wish for this. A large scale photorealistic open world post apocalyptic PVP game with dinosaurs, bases and more. (Size of a large country). I know this sounds a lot like Ark, but I am imagining a more advanced and realistic game where dinosaurs aren't the main part and PVP is very tactical.

You and your friends would start out with almost nothing and  expand your base. As you advance, you unlock new technology and you become able to capture more dangerous species. In order to find them you have to go around in jungles etc. and find them (some rarer than others). 
As you forge ahead you are able to control some of these dinosaurs and use them for your tribes/clans benefit. 

You would be able to create special buildings or create large scale projects to gain an advantage over your enemies and have something to strive for.

A community black market would also be in place where you could trade exotic rare dinosaurs with special traits and strengths. Or maybe rare parts for vehicles, weapons etc. 

As your tribe becomes stronger and you forge alliances for mutual benefits you are able to produce vehicles, more advanced weapons and equipment.

You could find other bases on the extremely large scale map and proceed to attack them for resources and territory. If your tribe is advanced enough it could start using them to attack and eliminate targets. Also a cool feature would be having the option the genetically modify the creatures like in Jurassic world.

Nightly, after the kids are down, I play from 8:30/9:00pm till 1:00am. To be fair, I might stream something on the odd night if I am feeling like a change from gaming. 

Spouse doesn't like gaming, sits there resentfully next to me doing stuff on the PC, but if they played a little we'd be doing more together and I might be more inclined do something else with them (I really only like to watch shows and play games, since outings are complicated with the kids).

Does anyone play a game and shout. Scream. Attempt to break pads. *insist* that they'll never play the game again and then instantly return to it? All of this, and eventually breaking through to the end credits and calling it one of the best games ever! Not a moment wasted.

Case in point - i love Zelda. Have since I was 16 (now 36) and am now going through each game from the beginning. Not the CDi games of course. I'm not an animal! 

I go through 1 and 2, both infuriating but by the end I feel a sense of elation. A great story told through struggle. Currently going through a link to the past. The map is a bastard to navigate, important items are hidden from view and the dungeons are infuriatingly hard at times. But still I walk away and I love it.

[My laptop config](https://preview.redd.it/dx5hlq5hyav41.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe413436335f31a0f24e325503fca13c5774374f)

Hi all! Thought i would share this with you. I just played my first real video game today, Halo. Growing up, household was always short on money to spend it on frivolities like video games. I had never played one single video game in my life, like ever. I realize there are millions of folks out there on the planet like me whos' priorities are day to day survival and not playing video games! So cut to 2020, I have finally made good of my life, I graduated with a PhD 2 years ago and work at a pharma major that pays GOOD.  However having grown up poor i still realize what it means to be so and despite all the success in my life, and I do plan on saving up as much as I can. So here's the specs for a laptop I own, i got it for some drug modelling work and other college stuff about 5 years ago. I got it speced out with a SSD last year so thing runs fast. I realize its not exactly a gaming monster. I got a xbox game pass for PC on a month's trial (yeah i am a stinking miser, sue me :) ). I was not expecting anything to actually work, maybe a few retro platformers like Broforce or the likes that I could punch for a few minutes. On a lark and out of boredom more than anything else, I downloaded Halo the masterchief collection and tried it out. And lo and behold, this shit is actually working! I am happily punching away now. Growing up, like any other kid, i have always wanted to play games that were a part of the zeitgeist like COD, gears of wars, god of war, Halo, and the likes just never could afford an Xbox or a Playstation. So, in summary, I have skipped major game and release for the past decade total gamer virgin here, please suggest two lists:

A) A list of 10 games that EVERY gamer needs to play once in their lifetime. Period.

B) A subset of A) or any other games (not exceeding 10 games) which are realistically playable on the setup that I have right now. please dont skewer me for having a normie gaming set-up, I will probably not buy a gaming device or a laptop till I have managed to finish this list (list B).",71,/r/gaming/comments/g8v40j/i_am_32_i_just_played_my_first_video_game/

I dislike Mario 64 DS. The other playable characters are the reason why.

To me, Mario 64 has a melancholic, lonely, perilous atmosphere. Like no other game ever made. When I think of the word ""melancholy"", my mind associates the word with Mario 64. No game has the atmosphere of Mario 64. It's uniquely *that* game.

With Mario 64 DS, that atmosphere is gone. The other playable characters make it feel like a happy adventure, rather than a lonely journey.

ft1tba,gaming,"I love Serious Sam 2,and I like it more than any other serious sam game."," Hello guys,as a serious sam fan(that videogame series,hope it gets more attention)  i want to tell you before that I finished both serious sam the first encounter and the second encounter classics,and the HD remakes,i almost finished 2 but I will soon play 3.My opinion is  that this game is a very good game,not ""garbage"" or ""shit money-grab""  that people say. My opinion is that this game is actually great and  actually competes with all ss games.Look,I get it,The first encounter  and the second encounter(especially the HD remakes) are amazing,the best  serious sam games,those were my childhood.And Serious Sam 3 is awesome  too due to the good graphics,improved gameplay,more  campaigns,secrets,etc. but everyone seems to hate Serious Sam 2 for  being too cheesy or too funny.Meanwhile,people would complain the first  encounter and 2th encounter are too serious or the jokes are not  funny.pretty  hypocrite.Cro-team wanted to try something new,and it  worked.Look,here is the thing,the sky is blue,grass is green,you cant  change that.If croteam tried to do a serious  game,half of the community  would be upset it did not have many jokes.If it was the opposite,the  other half would think it is too cheesy or funny.But if you try to do a  mix,and have little of both in one game,both sides will be unhappy.I  loved serious sam 2 dialogue,how Sam Stone now gets much more character  development,the colorful graphics,the good jokes,and the enemies(the fat  ones that attacked Simba City).The Gun play was even better in some  aspects than the first encounter in my opinion,mainly because the guns  felt easier to use.Yea it was very cheesy but it was extremely funny and  enjoyable,and it really seems like croteam really tried to make a good  game(and it did,my opinion).Such a shame it gets too much hate,people  focus on the negative side but never try to see the positive side(I am  saying that as a pessimist).For a 2005 game,serious sam 2 had god-like  graphics,and the serious engine(also used for the other games) was the  best,ahead of its time.Even better than source,it actually took a lot of  time and effort for other engines to truly defeat serious  engine.Also,after all,I love Serious Sam 2 not for the  graphics,dialogue,or enemies,mainly for the fact that it tried something  different and that I appreciate. No other popular franchise in that  time like call of duty,grand theft auto,etc. had the balls to make a change like serious sam  franchise did. It is an unique game,and that is why,in my opinion,serious sam 2 is  an underrated fps.I do not know how many users in this subreddit know  about serious sam,because doom,halo,duke nukem,etc. are much more  popular but I really hope serious sam gets more attention due to the fact that it is one of the most underrated,and best fps series ever,and because this post is not  meant to create an argument between the fans of serious sam(those who  dislike ss2 and those who don't) I respect others opinion,i understand  why people might not like it,i just hope serious sam franchise would get more love from Gamers and i am saying that as a guy who loves doom and halo.please do not hate on me,this is my opinion.",7,/r/gaming/comments/ft1tba/i_love_serious_sam_2and_i_like_it_more_than_any/

ftw6jy,gaming,Panasonic Q vs. Nintendo GameCube,"I think the Panasonic Q is what the Nintendo GameCube should've been from the start. The fact that that model came out not even a full month after the system's launch really says a lot.

The PlayStation 2 was successful because it was the next PlayStation, so it appealed to that fanbase of 102.49 million people who were looking for an upgraded gaming experience, and it was also a DVD player for $299, which was really cheap and helped appeal to an audience of non-gamers as well, probably turning some of them into gamers overtime.

Who's to say that this philosophy couldn't have worked for the Nintendo GameCube as well? It was the next Nintendo system, so it already had appeal to the 32.93 million people who owned a Nintendo 64, and it could pull the same DVD player trick as the PlayStation 2, especially since they had Panasonic by their side, who was a member of the DVD forum.

If they took the LCD screen off the front of the Panasonic Q to make it cheaper, released it worldwide, and never bothered with the original GameCube model at all, it could've been more of a hit and had a better ability to compete against the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. What do you think *you* would've picked up back then if those were your choices?",7,/r/gaming/comments/ftw6jy/panasonic_q_vs_nintendo_gamecube/

furaxv,gaming,Gaming and sleep - my experience,"Hi there, just thought I’d share my experience in case there is anyone else out there in the same boat.
So I’ve been an avid gamer most of my life, mostly first person shooters (halo, cod etc).
I’m not sure if I just can’t remember or if I had no problems with sleeping after gaming when I was younger, but I’m now 22 and the last few years I had been experiencing trouble sleeping. I always wondered why this was the case, I’m very active physically, eat well etc. So before I go to bed the last number of years, nothing made me as happy as hopping online and playing fortnite, cod or destiny, literally highlight of my day as is the case for many I’m sure. With work and college, the last year or so I haven’t been gaming as much and especially not at night time. Due to quarantine, I started gaming for multiple hours before sleep again. This led to not falling asleep for a few hours and then it hit me; my heart rate was elevated after playing a game of warzone and I thought could this be the reason I’ve been sleeping so badly? So I put it to the test, and have been gaming only during the day the last 3 nights; I have fallen asleep almost immediately the last few nights. So what I gather is that if you’re playing intense games before bed, maybe it’s due to me getting older also, then it COULD hinder your ability to fall asleep, makes sense I think. Your brain is stimulated in these intense games which makes it harder to switch off after playing. Maybe minecraft would work as a substitute?
Just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else was having trouble sleeping at night and was a lover of late night gaming with the squad. I don’t think you should let anything jeopardise your quality of sleep given how important it is to maintaining a healthy body and mind.
Hope this helps someone!",7,/r/gaming/comments/furaxv/gaming_and_sleep_my_experience/

fva1dk,gaming,I SEEK COUNSEL WITH THE GREAT ELDERS OF THIS COMMUNITY!!!,"Way back in 2016 I bought a PS4 (a FFXV Limited Edition, slim version) and since then it has brought nothing but joy in my life and I really love it. Sadly this year (around Feb 2020) while I was trying to platinum the Witcher 3, the game froze and was stuck like that. After that  my console started showing signs of the what my friends say ""THE BLUE LIGHT OF DEATH"" and it won't power up properly. I did what I thought was the best and took it to tge nearest Sony Service Center. Long story short the service center contacted me and they said that the unit's mother board and it need to be replaced and it would cost as much as buying a new PS4.

Now here is my dilemma should I have it repaired? Or should I buy a new PS4? (I know the PS5 is supposed to come out pretty soon but I don't make a habbit of buying consoles in their early cycles)

P. S. I'm sorry this is my first time posting in this community and I don't know if this belongs here. But I would love to get your thoughts...

In my case, because I'm more of a dodger than a blocker, I'd go for either light armor or no armor at all.

I know the first part of the remake is  going to be set in the beginning of the original game's story, up until the initial team leaves Midgar. Not even close to the end of disc 1. As far as avoiding spoilers goes, the new players should avoid researching the original story and characters entirely. That much they can do on their own, but there are a bunch of trolls online who are going to actively try to spoil it for them.

fwm3r9,gaming,VR system for PC?,"Hi all

I apologise if this has been posted already as I am new to the thread and after a read at the rules think I'm good to ask this here. If I'm on the wrong thread please redirect me.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** What's the best VR system for me to get for my gaming laptop? (laptop spec can be found below)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of getting into VR and been **heavily** considering it for months now.

When I had the money to invest I got cold feet as I didn't know what would be the best VR system to go for and started making excuses as why not to get one. I'm over it now and decided on getting one. Have been lacking funds to get one for a bit now but seeing as there is some coming my way very soon, I'm going for it.

The two main ones that spring to mind would be the Oculus and HTC Vive, I just don't know enough about them and when I do some research the opinions are so widely conflicting that I still am left undecided.

Right now I want to use it for Elite Dangerous but seeing the vast array of things that are out there to do, I don't see how I could run out of things to do with this.

I'm currently using a Laptop that I bought in 2017 for university work, and it's holding up incredibly well against everything I've thrown at it, some spec below:

**Model**: Medion Erazer Gaming Notebook X7849

**Processor:** Intel i7-6700HQ

**Graphics:** Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 with G-Sync

**RAM**: 32GB

If there's any more info about the system you need then hit me up and I'll do my best to get it for you.

I know that any screen tearing can be eliminated by using V-Sync but I've heard that it causes input lag. Is it really that bad? I can't afford a monitor with G-SYNC but can with AMD FreeSync. As I have a GTX 1060, FreeSync most probably won't work.

Why do I not see input lag when when V-Sync (Triple Buffering) is turned on? I've currently turned it on because my monitor is 60Hz &amp; I get screen tearing if my FPS goes above 60 or even if I limit the FPS to 60 using NVIDIA Control Panel. The only way is to use V-Sync.

fx0896,gaming,Nintendo Switch Lite: Worth it?,"this year is taking a toll on me. My laptop died, my xbone died, and finally, my poor PS3 died. all i do nowadays is eat, shit, watch tv, and sleep. i could use something to game on. 

im planning to get a nintendo switch lite this coming thursday. but there seems to be harsh criticisms of it by the fans. should i get it or just buy the regular?

the main criticism i see for the switch lite is that it can't connect to the tv. personally, idc. i don't plan on playing anything that really ""needs"" tv support for me to enjoy it. all im playing is animal crossing and wargroove which i do hope works well on handheld. plus i wander around the house all the time so it would be cool to play it anywhere i can.

but the criticism that really scares me is the joycon drift. ive already had all my stuff break, it would really fucking suck. so please let me know if this issue is incredibly common/inevitable and unavoidable for nearly any switch. thanks

so im wondering. should i just grab a switch regular or just buy the one ive been having my eyes on for a while? thanks again!",7,/r/gaming/comments/fx0896/nintendo_switch_lite_worth_it/

fx7pbe,gaming,Is 1440p the best gaming resolution for both classic and modern gaming?,"With the upcoming XBox Series X and PS5 the question is what is the best resolution monitor for all your games.  Integer scaling is the standard for scaling to get that ultra crisp look, having non integer scaling introduces either blurring or other scaling artifacts including shimmer during scrolling content.  People might say well 4K it is divisible by 240, 720 and 1080 and while for HD video and HD games that may be fine gaming wise it misses some of the most important resolutions 480.  480i /p  was the the mainstay of gaming from the Dreamcast to OG XBox it was the resolution of the VGA standard for PC gaming and has it's importance in both console, computer and arcade!  


So what resolution would unite all the main resolutions? ...  The answer is 1440p.  1440p can integer scale from 120p, 160p, 240p, 360p, 480p and HD 720p.  This will cover you from the Atari 2600 to the XBox 360/PS3 era where most of the games were designed for 720p native.  What about the modern consoles you ask, well The XBox One X has the majority of games outputting to 1440 native or can downsample from 4K.  The PS4 pro has many games rendering at 1440p native but they don't natively support this resolution output but this can be fixed with a software update or possibly the PS5.  PC Gaming currently has 1440p as the sweet spot as it is the resolution that can target higher FPS / refresh rates above 60hz while giving you a noticeable increase in resolution without being too taxing on your GPU.  


So how do you get 1440p with classic games, the answer so far is target 720p and hope the screen has a decent integer scale aware scaler.  That being said the upcoming OSSC pro will have the power to target native 1440p as well as the MiSTer FPGA system can output to even higher resolutions though you might have to put in custom video modes in it's settings file.  

What about 1080 you may ask?  What about 1080, in console use by the time it was relevant and supported people moved on to higher resolutions it wasn't till the current console generation that 1080 was even decently supported.    Before then only 1080i was supported and who really wants a degenerate interlaced signal anyway.  Most people will not even notice any real difference between 720p and 1080i besides the lack of interlacing artifacts.  Given the support and target towards 1440p on modern pro version systems it seems to be the ideal gaming resolution.  Now movie wise 4K monitors all the way but gaming wise from PC to Arcade to Retro 1440p will be the holy grail of gaming resolutions.

Would be nice to see some guide that both goes in detail about how different kinds of ppl can lead others and about what unsaid roles ppl usually have or what kind of ppl you want in your team, how to work with them etc. We're playing FPS games.

I've got myself into a situation where I grabbed new gaming mates of various skill level and nobody is the ""leader"" of the group, I am trying to fill the role as a challenge but the results are poor. No experience and no know-how plays a role but aside from that I am mostly indirect and rather informative, kinda democratic/diplomatic style where I don't handhold anyone but it's probably coming across too weak as people are not engaging correctly etc. I think what I say doesn't always equal to what I have envisioned in my mind plus I don't really get ppl engaging me back with ""that's a bad/good idea"" so maybe I just need to be more decisive without relying on someone supporting or disagreeing with me.

*(""Let's go in?"" = Let's go in, this is an amazing opportunity - unless if you're not ready for w/e reason then do speak up. / ""There's an enemy"" = Get ready, we're about to engage - don't go looting into Narnia or at least inform me so we retreat. / ""Why do you wanna go there? It's a bad idea."" = ppl still go there. ""We should close in, we're in a bad position"" = stop attacking them from here, we're going to die here and they have highground advantage.)*

fynfbz,gaming,Final Fantasy 7 Remake Amazon Shipping Delay,"I was wondering what others thought of the situation.

Let me first off say that I don't want something insignificant to get in the way of delaying necessary life-saving materials to people. That being said, I want to talk about the decision Amazon made to push back the shipping of this new game. I want to cover several scenarios that I'm hoping people can fact check and even answer some of my questions. My assumption, someone corrects me if I'm wrong. Usually, distributors get media like games and movies weeks in advance, which makes sense.

1. How come other parts of the world got FF7 released early? Why couldn't that apply everywhere? If Square Enix and Sony don't seem to care about the game being released first in other parts of the world, why couldn't the game just be released everywhere?
2. How is Amazon able to ship the game at all during the COVID crisis? It's not like COVID is going away any time soon. Why would we get our game 4-5 days after launch and not 30 days?
3. Logistics is what Amazon is all about, and it seems to me that if they can ship me the game a few days later, they could have sent it any time, including before the official launch date.

This delay in shipment seems oddly strange. I'm hoping that someone could bring more light to this situation. I'm noticing that on other sites talking about the launch of the game that several users had $30 discounts applied to their copy of the game, and now they're going to cancel their order and pay full price for digital. Can anyone shed light on when/where this $30 discount came originated? I can't shake the fact that this is related to something else. I'm currently sitting in my room with my tinfoil hat. Could Amazon want users to cancel their orders for some reason? Maybe due to selling more than they have or not getting enough on sales from discounts?

In my case, I ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game from Amazon on April 1st. I don't usually get the Deluxe edition of games because it often comes with content that I don't care for. However, to my surprise, when I went to order the standard version, it was not available. I was surprised by that, I've never seen a preorder not available on Amazon before. As a Playstation fan, I always like physical copies of my games so that I can look at them when they're on the shelf.

I'm sure this game is probably going to be the biggest game sell during the crisis. The game quantity to me could be challenging to fill compared to Resident Evil 3 that I received last week on time. If this is the reason, though, it seems like it would have been easy for Amazon to plan around it. Again, start shipping early, a certain percentage a day so that everyone could have their game by the release period.

But I don't want the full blame to be on Amazon, though. I feel like Square Enix/Sony could step in too to make things right for their fans. Could they make the game free to play for everyone for a week? Could they offer a small concession for the players who've been impacted?

For those of you who are impacted by the delay, what do you guys think about all of this?",7,/r/gaming/comments/fynfbz/final_fantasy_7_remake_amazon_shipping_delay/

fyzgja,gaming,Question about FFVII Remake,"Hi everyone,
So for now FFVII Remake is only Midgar, yet it took Square forever to release it. Of course they are not starting from scratch to produce the rest, as mechanics, character design and whatnot are already done, but considering the size of Midgar remade, that’s still a lot to finalize.
My question is: even if the rest of the game is produced only over a 5-years span, technology will advance (fact is that the game is developed for two different hardwares), and for a game (and a developer) which so heavily relies on graphics, I'm wondering how visible the gap could end up being between the first and last installments?",7,/r/gaming/comments/fyzgja/question_about_ffvii_remake/

fz75b6,gaming,New monitor for dual setup,"Hi.

I spend a lot of time in front of my PC both studying and gaming. I am studying to become an engineer, so a secondary monitor is a must-have for seeking information while writing reports.

But my current secondary monitor is &gt;10 years old, which is why I now want to buy a new one. My current primary monitor is a AOC 27"" LED Curved C27G1 that I bought \~2 years ago. I always have the primary monitor in the middle and the secondary to the side, so the secondary monitor is just for less relevant things.

I am hoping that some of you guys could help me decide what to look for in a new monitor, whether it is size, resolution etc.

My plan was to buy a new secondary screen cheap, but now that I have read so much about it, I'm unsure if I would be happier buying a new large 1440 IPS screen for my primary, and make my current primary my new secondary - or if a 27"" curved monitor to the side would be too much? If it's a world of difference I would not mind spending extra on it.

Any suggestions or own opinions will be highly appreciated!",7,/r/gaming/comments/fz75b6/new_monitor_for_dual_setup/

But now i believe they've taken a wrong path. For years now Valve has been neglecting the games that have made Valve what they are today, like Team Fortress 2. But the biggest issue I have now is from Half-Life: Alyx

Valve has always been about revolution and Ingenuity, But I really believe that they've gone too far with the VR element. HL1 was created when Personal Computers were becoming incredibly popular and cheaper. HL2 was made when those same PC's were getting upgraded and still becoming cheaper.  But HLA is made for COMPLETELY new hardware, with not enough research done for it to warrant the major return of Half-Life.

The absolute cheapest VR headsets with controllers are about 300$. All of which are incredibly cheap and not durable at all. I'm not so sad about HLA, I saw the game, saw the ending and was pretty happy. But i'm now incredibly sad because I wont be able to play the biggest return to a gaming franchise in over 2 decades just because the Hardware isn't ''there yet''

g12ddi,gaming,Thoughts on the increasing allowances of the ESRB?,"Before I get in to this post I want to make it absolutely clear that I don't have a problem with any of what I'm going to be describing. I like playing adult oriented games, so if anything I think it's a good thing.

Lately I feel like games have become significantly more violent than they have been in the past, and not just thanks to the advancements of graphics. In the past few years I've played through all of the newest Wolfenstein, Doom, and Resident Evil games. There is some seriously disgusting stuff there! Besides violence, I'm playing through the Final Fantasy 7 Remake right now and I am absolutely shocked at the amount of swearing this game has in it while still having a T rating. 

I remember being in high school when the whole San Andreas hot coffee situation was going down, and again with the violence in Manhunt 2. There were definitely a couple of other controversies with the ESRB around that time that I'm forgetting about, but the point is I remember they used to be *such* hard asses. And then you had jackasses like Jack Thompson. So what changed? I guess all forms of media make greater moral allowances as time goes on, but I feel like with the ESRB they adopted an anything-goes attitude at a much faster rate. 

What do you guys think? Is it even possible to have an AO rated game these days (short of something downright pornographic)?",7,/r/gaming/comments/g12ddi/thoughts_on_the_increasing_allowances_of_the_esrb/

2) It's a pretty old game. Maybe early 2000's?


3) I think it had to do with delivering packages. You could choose between a small car, a low rider and a truck. If you got enough of something you'd be able to temporarily use a tank. 

4) Steering wasn't a big deal if I can recall correctly, as the only you could do was basically switch lanes and accelerate.

g3gf20,gaming,Did anyone else dislike star wars jedi fallen order?,"I know this an unpopular opinion and I’m not trying to be controversial, I just wanted to share my thoughts on this game and see if anyone agrees or see what people liked about the game. My problems with the game were:

Bad combat. The enemy encounters did not feel like they were designed around this souls style of gameplay and the parry is inconsistent. The force powers were underwhelming and I was disappointed that there were no unlockable lightsaber combos and that overhead attacks used force meter.

The level design is bad from a gameplay stand point. When you die you have to restart from the last save point you were at. This works in dark souls because of the shortcuts you can find, and they are strategically placed for the most part. In this game they are too spread out with not enough shortcuts and its just frustrating having to trudge back to where you were.

Boring main character and story. Cal is just so bland. What is his personality? Whats motivates him? The story would have been better if the protagonist was actually interesting enough to care about.

Odd gameplay mashups. Souls style combat with uncharted platforming and prince of persia wall running. Didn’t really flow all that well in my opinion and the wall running felt bad. 

Bugs, glitches and crashing.

All in all, I just feel like this game is a weird mix of ideas that don’t really fit together all that well. The game would’ve worked better with a more DMC style combat system, just something faster paced to flow with the platforming sections better. I don’t think the game is bad, and the graphics and animation are great, just found it mediocre with a lot of problems that stopped me enjoying it more.",7,/r/gaming/comments/g3gf20/did_anyone_else_dislike_star_wars_jedi_fallen/

g3j5wv,gaming,Can someone explain to me how to deal with repetitiveness of modern rougelikes?,"I've recently been playing **""Children of Morta**"" and ""**Enter the Gungeon**"" and they are phenomenally fun games, but.... the design just makes you repeat the same segment of gameplay over and over with just a sliver of newness each time.

The usual structure follows something like this: play the first few levels, then fight a difficult boss, unlock next few levels, repeat. It's really fun at first, until 3 hours later you realize you're STILL playing the same first few levels over and over. You've seen all the rooms, you've seen all the enemies, you found all the perks. Yet, every time, you HAVE to repeat the same first 15 minutes.

In Gungeon, the boss difficulty is a stark jump from the level, which means you will die many times and thus have to repeat the same 15 minutes. You can't really ""rush"" the level since the only way to get an advantage is to get better gear, which means exploring the whole level. Now the REAL advantage is getting a new gun, but you find it maybe... once in every 5+ playthroughs?

And once you beat the boss, the next level is significantly harder than the first, which means you will die fast. So it's back to repeating the first level, all over again. You can't even practice on the new level until you slog through the same beginning again.

Once again, the gameplay of both games is super polished and fun, that's not the problem. The problem is the repetitiveness that starts to kick in after the novelty wears off. I just feel like I'm mindlessly killing the same enemies in the same rooms with the same weapons for 20 minutes so I can get to the 5 minutes of new challenge, die, rinse and repeat.

I... don't get it?

So I have some money and I want to upgrade the tech I have but I don't know what to buy:

1.Buy a pc with 8gb ram,an gtx 1650 or something like that,512gb ssd and Amd ryzen 5 3600 I think.

2.Buy the new iphone Se(and keep it for a long time) and also buy a laptop,Ultrabook lenovo 14"" ideapad S340, with the same specs of the pc but with a Radeon Vega 8.

For me both options are greate but I don't know which to chose 

Things to keep in mind:


-I see the pc as an investment because over time I can upgrade the specs but on the other hand In like 3 years I will go to colleague in other city(or country) and I will buy an better laptop,maybe an macbook and please keep in mind that.

-also I whould like to upgrade my phone because this one is preatty old and if I am not changing it  now I will keep it for at least 2 more years.


So which one option do you guys think is the best for me?Please help.

g46dvt,gaming,I have a craving and need a recommendation please.,"Hey guys and gals. So I have this major craving right now like I'm sure we all get where I just want to play a certain thing. My problem is I don't know if the thing I want even exists out there, like literally I don't know if it's a thing. I was all excited for Animal Crossing. I've never played one before New Horizons and so I kind of didn't know what to expect, but what I thought I was playing was a game where you run, RUN an island resort. I emphasize run because what I thought I was getting was a game where profit and stuff matters. I heard about the turnip market and fruit prices and thought something different for sure. And I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea I'm not knocking New Horizons I've still been playing it It's just not what I thought it was going to be.

So because it's not what I thought it was going to be I have this craving that remains unfulfilled. I really want to play something PS4, PC or Switch, where economics and profit matter against other human players. Think like if Stardew Valley had you competing in sales and stuff against other players farms. And when I say competing I don't want to unintentionally mislead, I don't necessarily mean there's a winner and a loser just an online functionality of sorts where profit and business cross paths with other players. One person I spoke with suggested the Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn, which while I want to play it anyway and I plan on trying it relatively soon here, I look at it and I don't believe the economy is that central in an MMO and by all means please tell me if I'm wrong. 

So does anyone have any suggestions on maybe a title I'm not aware of that could satisfy this craving? I really want to play something with other human beings that involves either profit margins or honestly even just a player to player economy where I'm trading this for that or selling this to player a to buy this from player b. 

Thanks, much love. ✌🏼❣️",7,/r/gaming/comments/g46dvt/i_have_a_craving_and_need_a_recommendation_please/

that said my favorite games that ive recently played are  
Dishonored  
Resident evil 2  
Resident evil 7  


im not one for first person stealth games cuz they make me feel weird but dishonored i just loved cuz of how youre superhuman yet fragile,Ive tried playing the 2nd one but my pc has a very poor cpu and goes to 30 fps in open areas at lowest settings so i dont play games that require too much cpu usage my gpu however is an rx 560 which is ok but not good for games that are demanding when combined with my cpu  
anyway the reason i like resident evil is bcz when u backtrack i always get excited about what il find the next time i go and its so satisfying finding a new gun.I dont like any other resident evils except re3 but my computer is just too bad to play it+ its 60 rn  
basically i dont enjoy indie games concidering im not a platformer guy and the non platforming indie games arent rlly that intresting so i just want something thats good  


i honestly dont know how to find games to play its very hard unlike finding movies to watch usually just randomly find one check imdb and if it has a good score watch it

g54avm,gaming,Bounty Hunter Game Idea,"I’ve had an idea for a while now. It’s Star Wars game based off of bounty hunting (have no idea for a title I need help with that). The basic idea is that you are a bounty hunter and you work to complete jobs given to you by random low life’s and eventually once your reputation has grown enough, Jabba himself. You would create your character at the start using a range of different civilizations and customizations after that. The jobs which you are given can range from robbery’s to murder and everything in between. Along your path you can encounter other bounty hunters such as Cad Bane, Bossk, and Dengar. This brings me to my next point. I believe the game should be largely based on the era of the galactic republic and confederacy as its arguably the most liked period of Star Wars. This would allow for many different scenarios and jobs as this was the outer rims prospering years. One final idea to add in is that you could create the ability to play as the other bounty hunters such as Cad Band, and create a multiplayer arena where you can 1v1 other bounty hunters using your unlocked gear. This arena will have a champion who can choose to keep playing until either he leaves with his prize, or loses (a double or nothing type system). The market for buying these weapons can be on planets such as florrum and tattoine (I think I spelled that wrong). As your reputation grows you can unlock access to new markets selling better gear.

g5cbfm,gaming,How Spiderman (PS4) reignited my hope…,"Be Greater.

Never has a slogan sounded so basic and so incredibly bland. At least, these were my initial thoughts as I finally got around to Insomniac Games’ Spider-Man during self-isolation.

I have to admit I popped in the disc because I’m working my way through my backlog and this seemed like a casual place to start. It’d gotten good reviews, people were talking about a sequel. It seemed right.

I very quickly saw myself in Peter Parker. Not in the “guy realises he’s a hero” way, but in the fragile, awkward, self-conscious do-gooder he tried to be way. I saw myself in Peter’s failures. I saw a guy I used to be, one I’d since lost through bad life experiences - an optimist to a fault.

It hit home when I saw Peter interact with people at F.E.A.S.T. and checking in with with his Aunt May, that this was a guy who cared about those he loved, and especially about those he didn’t. Throughout the campaign Peter would be pushed down, beaten, pushed to his limits and he still clung to his morals, even for complete strangers - when it almost always led to his detriment.

I realised quickly this was actually Peter’s greatest strength. The pursuit of good. Not a path that yields consistent results but a state that encourages him to want to help others. A journey.

Peter appreciated everything around him, good and bad, and therefore he was able to keep a level head and contribute as much as he could to every situation.

Something in me clicked.

When I first started playing, my first thought was “why doesn’t Spiderman go bad?” “all this tech and he won’t AT LEAST take a cheeky bag of money after stopping a crime?” “He is getting evicted from his apartment and won’t at least think about acquiring what he needs?”

But that’s the point - Peter, to his detriment, is about the pursuit of good. To rise above it…

**Be Greater.**

I never thought this game would have such a profound impact on me, but I feel like it’s given a part of me back I’d lost for several years. I implore those of you feeling similarly lost to give it a go. It might just get through to you like it did me.

Note: Completed the main story and all DLC’s 100% and wow was it good. Screwball is the Jar-Jar Binks of videogames though, and I hope she never returns for the sequel.",7,/r/gaming/comments/g5cbfm/how_spiderman_ps4_reignited_my_hope/

I have some simple questions SC players should be able to answer easily and i know they might be recurrent questions but i figured i'd be easier to just group them all here.

&amp;#x200B;

* Can it be played with a controller + mouse and keyboard decently? I'd like at some point to get a joystick but i'm not that much of a flight sim guy.
* Does it follow Eve in terms of online mechanics? Ships being lost forever? That sounds terrible especially since i've seen lots of bugs ending up dying or losing ships. Is there a different mode or a offline mode where ships aren't lost? Maybe you need to pay a fee to get them back?
* I've checked the specs but obviously i know the game is in a early state and not very optimized. It would suck to play everything at minimum graphics with a 1080ti and a i7 8700k. Anyone with similar specs can tell me their experience?
* How much can an average session last? For example if i have 2 hours to play, can i objectively do something?
* Also my dad used to me a MS Flight Simulator nerd and i'm sure he would love to try this. Is there a simply exploration mod without having repercussions of him crashing into things?

g7fsvq,gaming,A Video Game Library?,"Hi.

Something like this very likely exists already and I'm simply as uniformed as Sonic is unable to swim, but my head goes places every now and then... I just think it would be cool to have a library for video games, and operates in much the same fashion as book/video library. I'll explain it a little more in the following paragraphs...

Like a library, I would have a membership card that O could check out video games with. I can only check out so many items and have them to play for like two weeks or so before returning them. I could even place ""holds"" on video games I really would like to play and go check them out next time I could visit this library. 

During the pandemic, there could be an online library in which I could use my account info to have an item mailed to me. The game would come in a package that when the due date approaches, I can return it in the mail in the exact same passge (or kind like an election ballot for absentee where a return envelope is within the package). Maybe game systems could come with an app which is a virtual video game library for temporarily downloaded software.

Looking at this with a practical sense, I understand that the video game economy would take a nosedive in terms of the profit they would generate. Paid memberships may not do much to help that unless the vast majority of the population were to get such memberships. I don't know, I just think something like that would be enourmously benefical in this time.

Again, something like this most likely already exists and I'm just a little too out of the loop for comfort, but thanks for sticking with my silly imagination anyway.",7,/r/gaming/comments/g7fsvq/a_video_game_library/

g7glg9,gaming,Do you think it will still be worth it to wait a year after launch to get a PS5?,"I've never gotten a console at launch. I've always been at \*least\* 2 years later, or more usually, just because of money. But I'm considering saving up to get the PS5 right away this time. Our 10+ yr old TV is finally dying, and we'll be replacing it likely by the end of the year. This means we'll have a TV that makes a console with high end graphics actually worth it. And the biggest reason, is that the PS5 will be able to play PS4 games.  
I've always heard people say ""wait a year to get next gen consoles"", and their main reason is the game selection. But this time, I already have the games I love from PS4 playable, so I wouldn't feel that void.  
Another thing people say is to wait for the upgraded version to drop. If there is a PS5 Pro, I doubt I'd feel the need to upgrade. I've already happily gone without 4K for a long time, and having the absolute-best-possible graphics isn't a huge deal to me.

So with all that, only really talking about possible hardware defects. Is this a big enough of an issue to wait?

g85gkf,gaming,"Why are Elves so popular in games and Vampires so rare, while Zombies and Mages just dominate them both?","I notice for example Vampires and Werewolves are pretty much dead in gaming, super rare for any game dev to make a game centering around these guys or even have them in the game in any capacity at all. There were some good titles but years apart like Legacy of Kain, Castlevania, and VTMB but other than those its pretty dead. And tbh, not a fan, while the concept sounds interesting it also seems kind of lame to me not sure why though.

Books with Vampires and Werewolves are popular for things like Urban Fantasy and strangely Supernatural romance style novels (why does this exist?), but strangely pretty rare in more historical setting Fantasy. 

They also occasionally show up in movies and television shows like Interview with the Vampire, Underworld, Twilight, Blade, True Blood but they are niche there and their popularity kind of waxes and wanes with the times but never truly just die.

&amp;#x200B;

Then on the other hand we have Elves, Elves are very popular in the gaming scene from Tabletop Games like Warhammer to AAA multi-million dollar budget video games. Some of the most famous being Zelda series, Elder Scrolls, World of Warcraft, hell pretty much most RPGs set in a traditional Fantasy setting has Elves in some capacity in them.

Elves are decently popular still in Fantasy books set in magical medieval times. Elves however are pretty rare in urban fantasy and things like super natural romance.

But, Elves are super rare on the big screen, other than like Lord of the Rings I can't remember any Elf movies that didn't involve Christmas Elves.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's Zombies which pretty much exist in every genre of fiction from books to games to movies zombies reign supreme.

I’ve done multiple 100% play throughs of RDR2 and during my latest I collected all the trophies in story mode, Some were easy but the one that required getting mauled and surviving eighteen bear attacks diminished my enjoyment.

Artwork, Story(ideas), Combat, feeling of OP

All the images I’ve ever seen of these games reminded me of that combat system, so I figured what the hell let’s give it a try.

By probably a third of the way through my core team was consistently able to one shot just about any enemy...which made actually catching anything a pain in the ass. Maybe because I’m an adult, having the presence of mind to have a diverse team really reduces difficulty levels. It’s hard to imagine even kids under 10 struggling with this game. If you can read, you can beat it.

This is where lifelong players probably say to me, “that’s why it’s about catching them all and evolving them and making different ones stronger” etc. etc.

Even knowing that’s basically the point of the game, I didn’t expect it to be so goddamn annoyingly repetitive. It literally has only two mechanics on the world’s weirdest rock-paper-scissor system.

1) Fight random things 

2) Catch random things

But I also have Hollow Knight, and discovered shortly after starting it that I can't select a node to use for my map (node? is that what it's called? I quit so quickly in frustration I can't recall). My little guy is also always looking up, which is fine now, but I can't imagine it will be great later when the difficulty gets amped up. 
I tried contacting Nintendo support, but...well, there's a pandemic going on and that's not happening. I also tried to fix my Switch Lite myself, but one of the screws are stripped. Yay.
So, that leaves me with, right now, Animal Crossing and A Street Cat's Tale to play without really needing my right stick. 
I might try to fix the screw, or I could wait it out until Nintendo can repair my brand new console, but I really want something else to do on my breaks at work. And having a Lite around that I've barely touched...it's depressing. 
So...do you guys know of any games I can play that will not be kind of hard to play without the right stick, or with a wonky one, at that?

tl;dr: My Lite has drift in the right stick and I need a game I can play without that being a problem?",7,/r/gaming/comments/g9p0z3/any_games_on_the_switch_that_do_not_use_the_right/

fvq60t,gaming,Extremely frustrated with state of gaming.,"This Covid lockdown is really bringing in to focus how great it would be to have a good game to play. But there just aren't any, as far as I'm concerned. The last great game was Skyrim. The last time ""all games were fun, not great, but fun enough and there's lots of variety"" was on the ps2/xbox generation of consoles. But it was always this way from NES/sega/MSDOS era through to ps2/xbox. ps3 is where variety and fun died, but in exchange we got rare gems of epic greatness... fallout 3, red dead redemption, skyrim...

Now we've lost that and have nothing. That's how I feel.

I seriously can't think of a game I want to play. I go to the ps store ready to spend money and I end up just shrugging and leaving. Red Dead Redemption 2 was the last game I had high hopes for, like fallout 4 before it it fell flat for me. Even the sports games, which I used to just play and zone out on... they're not hitting the mark. Like they want to frustrate you into spending money, which I would do if I actually got something enjoyable out of it.

Maybe the effort is being put into this popular fortnite/apex legends crap... I can't even begin to look into that, but what I've seen looks awful.

fvly2e,gaming,"Help , I’m having some rough times with my friends","NOTE : this message is kinda long BUT I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP 

Let me explain some stuff before I ask for your advice... I usually “play” with 3 guys (when I say play I just mean chatting in a PS4 party ... that’s the whole problem which I get to it later ) , I’ve known these guys since I was 9 , they’re my “best friends “ but lately I enjoy the company of only one of them (I don’t dislike the other two but recently we argue A LOT more often, so they just drain my energy nowadays ) , I don’t dislike chatting with them in a party but if had the choice of either 1-chatting with your friends OR 2- playing games with your friends , I would choose the 2nd option ... And they’re REALLY picky about what kind of games they play ( they only choose either games that have an above decent story or they have to be rated 9 or 90 above in IGN or metacritic and overwatch ... and even then even if a COD game is rated above 90 they won’t play it because they don’t like First Person Shooters , they don’t like Ubisoft games , they don’t like rockstar games , they don’t like racing games ... if I had to give a percentage on how much they play those games : 49% single player games - 49% overwatch - 2% CooP games ) ... I myself am more of a multiplayer guy than a singleplayer guy and I really love playing games with friends but I genuinely can’t play overwatch , it’s really not fun for me , it’s too unbalanced and players nowadays use REALLY annoying tactics to win and they play REALLY dirty ( I really liked the game itself and the concept of the game but the players were so annoying) ... so now the only games I can play with them are CooP games (since I can’t play singleplayer games with someone else) and they only play CooP games for 2% (which is like 1-2 hours in 3-4 days , sometimes even a week ) ... one thing that I really kinda hate about them is that they don’t wanna try new games and genres , like they actively avoid it but I’ve tried every single game they told me to try and absolutely loved all of them (except overwatch) and most of them were games I would’ve never imagined I would play someday like dark souls 3 - sekiro - final fantasy 15 ... but they don’t wanna even try one of the games I recommend ( they all even have a copy of gta 5 so they don’t even have to pay for it but they don’t wanna play because it’s “pointless “ which I kinda agree but the whole point of the game is to do dumb shit and have fun doing them ) but I will say that one of them actually played battlefront 2 and liked it but since no one else of my friends got that game he went back to playing overwatch with those guys .... so pretty much all of my gaming experience has been : “ join my friends party — chat for 30% —- hear them gaming with each other 60% — argue 10% — wish we could play with each other 100% ) also keep in mind that I used to play online games with some other friends but they don’t get online much lately , but I really enjoyed playing with them .... what do you think I should do ?",61,/r/gaming/comments/fvly2e/help_im_having_some_rough_times_with_my_friends/

ftavtd,gaming,Console/PC Buying Advice (A complete noob lol),"Hi so I've never really been a gamer (just play sims on my mac &amp; used to play on a Nintendo ds and wii lol) but I've been wanting to get into gaming for a long time now. 

I just don't know what to buy: A gaming PC, Switch, Playstation, Xbox or what?

I love simulation games (Sims, Prison Architect &amp; Planet Zoo, which I desperately want to play but isn't available on mac) and story based games (Detroit Become Human &amp; Last of Us), also have enjoyed more chill stuff like anything mario related, animal crossing, professor layton lol. Other stuff I might like to try out include zelda, portal, firewatch, minecraft, red dead redemption &amp; the stanley parable if I hadn't already watched the game played through!

You might've noticed my problem by now, that my interests are quite varied I have no idea how to decide which purchase would be best for me! 

Any opinions/advice would be hugely appreciated! I really hope this doesn't get buried!!

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I ask now because I was going to buy a switch because I appreciate a handheld A LOT (and for animal crossing &amp; mario), but I wasn't sure if it was worth it for the money &amp; amount of games that interest me. But I also know it's probably the cheapest option, so I have considered getting that for now and saving up for like 5+ years for one of the other more expensive options.",6,/r/gaming/comments/ftavtd/consolepc_buying_advice_a_complete_noob_lol/

ftzwp2,gaming,Beating multiplayer performance anxiety,"Hello Reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I want to talk about a very serious issue I've been having for the last few years now. I was originally going to post this in a specific game's subreddit but I figured I'm not the only one facing this issue. I'm sure more gamers are facing this across many different multiplayer games, so here we are.  


**THE PROBLEM IS: I CAN'T GET MYSELF TO PLAY IN MULTIPLAYER MODES, RANKED OR UNRANKED ALIKE, BUT I WANT TO.**

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get into the specifics. Whenever I find a good game I like that offers mainly multiplayer gameplay, the story almost always goes like this. I go through tutorials and whatnot to understand the game, then I try to practice a bit on bot games or offline/single player campaigns and so on so that I am ready to ""go for real"" in multiplayer modes. Few examples: I've played LoL for years and barely did anything else than bot games. I have been a subscriber to iRacing for a year and a half now, with a whopping 3 races under my belt. I have recently got CoD Warzone in PS4 and I have played a few matches but I can't get myself to start the game again (and not because it's a bad game).

&amp;#x200B;

In many many cases, I feel like I understand the game pretty well. The problem isn't there. I know what I have to do. For some odd reason, I always feel pressured to perform in ""real"" matches. And unfortunately, as I don't have any experience and practice in ""real"" games, I tend to suck. Which in turn kills my confidence and makes me put off playing again. I always feel like ""I should be doing better"" because offline things are good, I'm not a dumb person, I understand what I have to do, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

A point that was made eventually was maybe I'm not ""made"" for MP games, but I do not think this is true. My best gaming memories are in MP modes, but almost always when I was playing with friends. Modern Warfare 2 lobbies with the boys, good old Halo LANS, even playing World of Warships with my brother and his friends is cool. In these situations, I just seem to ""forget"" about it all and just enjoy the game.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem really stands when I play alone, and when my performance is really ""mine"". As in I don't get carried into free wins with my friends that play better than me. Moreover, as I got older, I have lost contact with my gamer friends and whoever I have left do not enjoy the same games as I do. So I can't really rely on just gaming whenever someone else can join in.

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, posting all this on Reddit. In this I hope to maybe find other players in the same type of issue that I am to maybe support each other! Best would be to have tips and ideas on how to defeat this beast maybe from players who've been there and got over it?

As far as Animal Crossing, here are my concerns/questions:
1. What is there to do in terms of any combat/dungeons/equipment crafting? Anything?
2. Are there character customization options, or outfits?

For Dark Souls:
1. Are the classes distinct enough to feel different?
2. Can we play through the entire game together (I understand we would need to kill the bosses twice if we wanted equivalent advancement in our separate games)?

Does anyone have input on which direction we should go? We would be playing these exclusively through online coop. The other game we’re playing a lot right now is Diablo 3.

So does 3 have the same type of situation? Or do Zombies get put down permanently like they do in basically every other Resident Evil game (I've played them all except funny enough 2 and 3).

furs78,gaming,QUESTION: What games that are remade/remastered on the same platform as the original? (PC excluded),"Like the title said, I'm wondering since I knew three games that were like that. It's just interesting to know. Here's the criteria:
&gt;PC versions/games are excluded since it's only one platform, so no games like Half-Life and Black Mesa.

&gt;Original games that are ported to newer gen consoles (like collections or official emulations) are considered being on the same console as the remake/remaster. Hidden/secret games inside of other games counts too.

&gt;Backwards compatibility doesn't count.

The games that I know that were remade/remastered on the same platform:

-Atelier Rorona and Atelier Rorona Plus (PS3)

-Megadimension Neptunia VII and Megadimension Neptunia VIIR (PS4)

-Destroy All Humans! (PS2 emulation) and the remake (PS4)

-Trials of Mana (from the Collection of Mana) and the remake (Nintendo Switch)

furvoo,gaming,What to play online with family. PC/Mac,"Looking for a game for family fun while staying at home. Usually we play board games, but we decided not to meet due to covid-19. We're split in two. It's my parents and bro, who have two Macs and one PC in one house (and a PS4), and me with gf with two Macs and a spare PC in the other. So it basically has to be a game playable across platforms (or hot-seat on two computers). We would like to meet online to play something enjoyable. We were thinking Heroes 3 or Talisman, but turn-based games could be boring in this set up. So another idea was an FPS or something real-time.

We could use some recos.

Naturally I Google the issue and they say to repair the game. I just downloaded it, but I repair it. Doesn’t work. Then they say, for every game, oh it must be something on your end. Start your PC in security mode or something, try the game, and if it works do a process of elimination to determine what on your computer is preventing you from playing.

Why? I don’t have this issue with Steam games, they all just work. Same with blizzard games. Games that I fucking pirate don’t have this issue.

So of my 6 games, Dragon Age: Inquisition and Republic Commandos straight don’t work, Dragon Age: Origins required me to enable v-sync to work, Mass Effect 1 required me to enable console commands and turn off background light in order to work, and then deleted 5 hours of progress due to cloud not syncing. Cities: Skylines I just didn’t find fun. And Battlefront 2 was both fun and worked without some sort of work around.

So please don’t make the same mistake I did. They deserve to go out of business and sell their IPs to Steam. Maybe then I can actually enjoy their games.",6,/r/gaming/comments/fv9wit/do_not_get_origin_access/

fvby3c,gaming,Which Switch(Lite) Game Should I Get First?,"
So long story short I have never owned a Nintendo console before but I always felt like the games were my type, I have finally worked the money to buy a Switch Lite(already have a PS4 and as a teenager it is quite hard to make money doing chores around my house) the question is  which game should I get first? As I mentioned before it takes me quite a lot of time to earn my money so I will probably spend quite some time until I can get a game after I get switch and also quite a lot of time to buy games after that, the games I was wanting to play the most were these(I’m open to any suggestions):

Super Smash Bros Ultimate(played it at a friends house a week ago, it was sooo fun)
Zelda BOTW(heard a LOT of good stuff about this game, I’m okay with open world games but this title looks fun)
Pokémon Sword and Shield/Let’s go(used to be obsessed with Pokémon when I was younger, never played a Pokémon game, both games look real fun)
Super Mario Odyssey(looks a lot fun to me and heard some good stuff bout it too)
Animal Crossing(Never played any AC game but the new one looks really fun and I really like that type of game)
Mario Kart 8(don’t have many friends so I’m not sure about this one, still loved playing at my cousins house as a kid)
Splatoon 2(my friend loves this game and I like the idea)

fvxge5,gaming,I need a little help with Perfect Dreepy Farming/Math. Pokemon breeders and Mathematicians wanted alike!,"So you fall into one of those categories! Sweet! Or maybe you just saw ""Perfect Dreepy"" and couldn't resist. Who am I to judge?

Well, as the title says, I'm farming for perfect Dreepy's in Pokemon Sword. However, I'm stuck on a little bit of the math involved. 

As any breeder would know, the Destiny Knot ensures that 5 IVs get passed down from the parents to the child. The 6th is left to random chance (0 to 31). So here is where my question arises: if I have a mother Dreepy with ""best"" IVs in all but Special Attack, would pairing it with a Father with the same IVs be best? Or pairing it with a father with best in all but special defense?

My math tells me that in the first case, there is a 1/6 chance that Special Attack gets randomized, and a 1/32 chance that it gets randomized as a perfect 31. This means it's a 1/192 chance I get a perfect Dreepy from their union. 

In the second case, every stat has the potential to get passed on as ""best"" from a parent. I see this as a 1/2 chance that special attack gets passed as perfect, 1/2 chance that special defense gets passed as perfect, and then a 1/32 chance that the randomized stat happens to roll as perfect. That seems to me to be a 1/128 chance at a perfect Dreepy.

Currently, I have them set up in the second case, because I think that's the better math. However, I'm not confident that I'm right, hence I'm here. If anyone could tell me which path to take/how to improve my method, I would be very grateful.

And for anyone still reading this, if you came because you saw perfect Dreepy, yes, I am wonder trading all my (near perfect) duds, and if you really want one, I would totally give them out. Thanks for checking out my post!",6,/r/gaming/comments/fvxge5/i_need_a_little_help_with_perfect_dreepy/

fwax1q,gaming,What style of horror games do you prefer?,"What I am referring to is basically 3 different types of horror games. So which do you prefer:

\-The walking around and hiding horror game  
In these horror games you mainly have no possibility to defend yourself from the danger which is lurking around in the game to kill you.  Also there might be no real danger at all which might be able to kill you. So either you have to run away, or there are just eerie, scary atmosphere and only contain jump scares.  


Games which might fit this description: Outlast, Layers of Fear, Slender, P.T., Amnesia  


\-The games where you can barely protect yourself, but at least you can do something, i.e. survival horror  
I am referring to games where you have at least something to be able to defend yourself. So these games still might scare the shit out of you, but there is no 100% necessity to run away, because you can at least defend yourself somehow.

Games which might fit this description: Alien: Isolation, Silent Hill and old school Resident Evil games (I would say), Fatal Frame, Siren Blood Curse

\-The games where you face a fear, are horror styled and you get scared, but you have good means of defending yourself pretty well. It is scary, but you won't be dead in matter of some hits.

&amp;#x200B;

Games which might fit this description: Dead Space, F.E.A.R., Resident Evil 4,5 (?), The Evil Within, 

&amp;#x200B;

Which style of games do you prefer?  
Do you think if you are ""packed"" and able to properly defend yourself, the horror aspect of games might suffer?  


In advance: Sorry if this post might not be written in the best style or not everything is described well, but I still hope yo get what I want to convey and mean.

fwhrx6,gaming,My first experience with Xbox 1,"I'd never played xbox one or PS4 because I can't afford to buy one, and I don't spend much time with other people.  My friend let me borrow his, and the first and only game I've played is Red Dead 2.

All I can say is that I'm floored.  I've never been so impressed by a game.  The voice acting, the score, the story, I feel deeply involved.  I feel like playing all the side missions, not just because I can, but because I could be very happy just hunting and providing for the camp in this game.

I've only just started, and it's hands down the best game I've every played.  I thought RDR was good, and I was excited for this one, but it's blown past all my expectations.

I know this is probably very old news for all of y'all, but I wanted to share somewhere that it might be appreciated.  I can only imagine what games will be like 20 years from now if it's already this in-depth and beautiful.

fwj1jl,gaming,[HELP] Bad Nvidia Graphics (Ride3/FH4),"Hey gamers!

I'm new, I hope to explain everything correctly. I've been noticing problems lately on almost all video games (including GTA5).

In practice it is as if the render distance would be reduced and only once I get closer the game / gpu starts to re-index the objects.

I state that I play all games at High / Ultra at 60FPS constant in most cases.

Thank you in advance, please help me (in my opinion it's some bad setting in my Nvidia panel)!

fwkosp,gaming,Recommendations for RPGs on PS4 or PC,"Hey everyone, hope everyone is keeping safe. 

I'm getting furloughed and need a new game to get into. 

I'm looking for a RPG on the PS4 or PC that is semi-open but not too big that it takes ages to complete a fetch quest, not text heavy for the narrative/lore and has the option to grind. I've just completed Ni No Kuni Remastered for the PS4 and I think those were the points that got me 'hooked' to that game. The next logically step would be the sequel but I'm not sure with the complete change in game mechanics if I'd get into it.

Pillars of Eternity and Divinity Original Sin were on my radar but I get the feeling these will both be text heavy.

Does anyone know any RPGs I should take a look at?

fx0t8b,gaming,RDR2 or GTA 5?,"Please mind, this post is heavily based on opinion. Tell me what you think and what my rights and wrongs were!
MAP:
Both maps are very big. The first Red Dead was 12 Miles. The second was huge, estimating at around 29 miles. As I’m not sure for how big GTA’s map is, all research I have done has concluded that RDR2’s map was way bigger. There are so many things to do in both. The map makes up for everything in the game and gives the game play time, even if you finish it. Obviously, GTA is more of a modern situation compared to Red Dead in the end of the 1800’s. Everything in RDR2 is obviously older. The textures in both games have problems but that is what we are talking about in the next section.
GLITCHES/BUGS:
There were many bugs in both games but RDR2 had a few texture problems, a lot of glitches, and some other bugs that really made the game funny or just completely annoying. The horses in RDR2 are just straight annoying sometimes and bug off into doing there own thing. They will do it no matter what. They don’t care if they have a good happiness or not, they don’t care about your bond with them, and they don’t care about their stamina. They almost always do there are thing. In GTA, I have not personally seen many glitches. I usually play online with more players, that supports the fact too. Usually, more players can make the game harder to run due to the fact... there is just more players. It’s online and you can’t do anything about. GTA does have private online sessions though. Grind that if the bugs and players are annoying.
WEAPONS:
Ok, this is an obvious winner. Back in the 1800-1900’s, we didn’t have much weapons. RDR2 doesn’t have even close to the variety GTA has. The weapons in both games are fun to use, I can’t lie about that. Don’t you love sniping with a Repeater Shotgun, or don’t you love blowing up random people with sticky bombs? Yes, I am a troll too. Wait... you said you aren’t a psychopath? Tell the police and you’ll.. back on track. The guns in RDR2 don’t do much damage, counting out most rifles and shotguns. The sniping shotguns are kind of annoying. In GTA, I feel the shotguns don’t do enough. There isn’t really a balance in between both games on the weapons. It’s either too little or too much. This is pretty much a con for both games. Some weapons are ok, but I’ll sticky to sticky bombs! See what I did there... oh. I’m not funny? Really?
MONEY/MISSIONS:
Ok, this is where the heat in the comments come in (if they haven’t come in already!) I personally think that RDR2 has better missions. I think most GTA missions are the exact same. “Steal this car!” or “Kill all of them!”. I feel that RDR2 has a variety of missions. The money systems are obviously different since they are in different times. More modern cash systems in GTA and older, more rare, to find money in RDR2. Back in the late 1800’s and most other times before now, money was different. $8 was way more back then than it is now. Some might think that everything in GTA costs more than in RDR2 but no, everything in RDR2 is dead expensive. This means it makes it harder to progress online, or in the story mode. GTA is a different story, leveling is definitely easier and so is buying stuff. The process is do a few missions, go to the store, and buy stuff. RDR2’s process is more... “Do 17 missions to buy an outfit for your character, no shoes included.” 
FUN:
Now this all comes down to everyone’s opinion since everyone thinks differently. For me, I enjoy screwing around in RDR2 online with some friends. I find GTA kind of boring. Please don’t hire a hitman on me, I’m sorry. I just really enjoy RDR2 but tell me your opinion in the comments. I would love to read all of them. Give me some stories you’ve had in the game, again I love reading what the people of Reddit have to say. Please don’t track me down and kill me, I’m out!

Infamous 2 (Actually I was thinking on skipping it and play second son directly)

PS4

Infamous Second son  
Fallout 4

There's so few current gen games I really want now, which is why until now I haven't upgraded from my 360 yet. I plan to finally pull the trigger but after 7 years of this gen and only 16 games at most I care about, plus I don't have a 4k tv, I'm finding it hard to imagine it being worth it to get the series x. All I really want for last gen ports are the next tomb raider game, assassin's creed, batman arkham and the wolf among us 2. If the the  xbox One got ports for those future games I would really have no reason at all to buy next gen.  So do you guys think last gen ports are likely to happen?",6,/r/gaming/comments/fx7mk5/will_current_gen_consoles_get_ports_of_next_gen/

fxdean,gaming,"Looking for a ""WASD"" mouse","Once upon a time I had a gaming mouse which I rigged up to use its side buttons as the WASD buttons, freeing up my keyboard.  I liked playing that way, having all my movement on the mouse and all my abilities on the keyboard, but I stopped because I couldn't move diagonally or rock easily between buttons with the WASD buttons all dependent on one finger.

I'd like to give that control scheme a go again, the ideal way to do so would to have a mouse with 2 buttons for the thumb and two for the pinky, so I can rock between forward-backward with my thumb and left-right with my pinky.

So does anybody know of any gaming mice that would fit that criteria?

fy60g8,gaming,Survival game advice,"So basically I've been generally curious about survival/crafting games (I have a love-hate relationship with them) and have a couple hundred hours of Rust played and have enjoyed it quite a bit.

However, I am a solo player (not because I don't have anyone to play with but rather because I prefer to play this kind of game solo) Rust often ends up being a less than ideal experience for me, with ""map wipes"" happening before I build up anything significant and clans putting a bit too much of a fight.

I've been tempted to get Ark on the current Steam sale but I've heard a lot of bad things about the game, from it taking dozens of hours to tame some animals to devs having abandoning it in an unfinished state and moving on to other projects.

For this reason, I thought this might be a good place to ask around for everyone's advice on a good game within the genre especially for someone playing solo.

I've heard The Forest is pretty good though I get the impression it's a bit more of a horror game than survival/building. I've also heard Green Hell is pretty good but from what I've seen it appears quite similar to The Long Dark, which I own and couldn't really get into it (it sort of lacked the ""sandbox"" feeling I get from Rust).

fz1zha,gaming,Best current strategy games? (PC),"I used to play some RTS games years ago, like Red Alert, Age of Empires and briefly Civ 5 in the following years but I have not really gotten into one since then.  I'm looking for a change of pace now with my gaming, (been on Dark Souls series and FPS games mostly since then) so I'd like to try and get into a couple of strategy games.  I think I might like one that's maybe more combat focused like command and conquer and maybe one that's more sort of empire style with politics and all that jazz So what do people think are the best games from each style?.  


Also I'm wondering if I should approach it by going back in time to some older games (e.g. I have the Dawn of War series on Steam) or are there just more games out now that do it all much better and would be more enjoyable?

At the moment I have access to game pass and origin access so something from there would be nice, or I could maybe pick up another game if it's on the cheap, but I will take recommendations for purchase when I have some spare money!

Here’s how it works when you buy something. 

You purchase it, you untick all the offer tick boxes, you decline the purchase protection shield and the transaction completes. 

But what ALSO happens without you opting in is you are automatically signed up for their monthly plus service. It’s a little tick box after the transaction completes. You know, that time you think your all done and go off. 

If you don’t want this monthly subscription you have to opt out of this additional purchase. You can’t just walk away as they’ve already signed you up without warning.

g0d6kf,gaming,Switch vs. Oculus rift S,"So I've been saving up a lil money to get a oculus rift s. But now im not sure. I have a very good running computer ready for a VR headset but the switch is more... Appealing. I've had a switch before but it broke and i forgot to get a damn warranty on it. The oculus is just a new experience seeing its very popular nowadays as well. The switch is very portable yes, but I've seen so many things similar to the switch. The quest is a big no no for me so forget that. 

Pros for switch: small room, 65 inch TV ( something like that), No siblings, live with a roommate meaning multiplayer, small and portable.

Cons for switch: Common experience, not a Nintendo nerd ( not calling anyone a nerd), not a lot of space to put the actual system.

Pros for ORS: New experience( for me anyway) pretty fun games in my opinion, exercise in the process, customisation is endless, runs good, all day play

Cons for ORS: not at all play on the go, accessories pretty expensive for an average joe like me, can get awfully nasty and dirty after long sessions, non switchable face pad ( that's where the accessories come in), non adjustable lenses like the quest


I will now ask this subreddit to give me some ideas, tips, and their experiences with one or the other, or both if your a chad",6,/r/gaming/comments/g0d6kf/switch_vs_oculus_rift_s/

g0sxq4,gaming,Crackdown 4 ideas,"In my opinion Crackdown 3 had some excellent ideas that weren’t received too well as they deviated from the norm of Crackdown 1 and 2s gameplay. An entirely new Crackdown experience can be created by mixing the best of both.

For example, Crackdown 3 gave players the ability to enhance XP collection of a certain category that related to the agents background. However in doing so, for this benefit to apply to one save slot, different agents lost  the ability to have separate save slots and individual character development.These 2 ideas could be combined into the concept of Agency factions. A faction of sorts can be found in Crackdown 3 in which Commander Jacob leads a team of agents with a duck mascot and team exclusive explosive weaponry ( the clusterduck grenade and the quack hammer gun )designed for crowd control. Factions could all have weapons oriented towards their combat style maybe having a faction with heavy weaponry that only shoots 50cal. bullets or a faction that also increases the shooting skill. This could also come with matching mascots on the uniforms such as the tiny duck hologram located in Commander Jaxon’s shoulder.This way seperate agents can keep their seperate save states and different XP levels but can switch factions for these XP boosters and weaponry.

Another example would be to take the idea of new driving abilities becoming available as the driving level increase such as guns on the super car in Crackdown 1 becoming available at a later stage with the idea of transforming car for quick and easy manoeuvring around diverse terrain.",6,/r/gaming/comments/g0sxq4/crackdown_4_ideas/

g160v4,gaming,Final Fantasy VII Remake - a bug has ruined the game for me.,"(Minor Spoiler Warning ahead) Let me just start by saying this: I was enjoying this game very much! I've never played the original FF7 but I was intrigued by the characters and world-building. Not to mention the gorgeous character models and breathtaking environments, with a satisfying combat system... I was hooked.

Then I got to to Chapter 9 : The City that Never Sleeps. And the game decides that I am no longer allowed to run. Yes, I have now been forced to slow walk since the transition to Ch 9. Now I know that there are many sections in this game that force you to slow walk. But this section is not one of them!

For context, this is the section where you go through the large tunnel and encounter masked bandits, and use the robot arms to lift Aerith onto platforms. Slow walking through this long tunnel was near insufferable, but I slogged through to the end and got to the playground and met with Tifa in the Chocobo Carriage. And I thought now that I'm heading to Wall Market, maybe the glitch would fix itself. But nope! I am still being forced to slow walk even throughout Wall Market.

Yes, my R2 button still works; I was still able to use it to cycle through my party and use items/spells. I also tried switching to my other dualshock 4 controller, and it's still broken. I deleted the game and reinstalled it... still no good. No, I will not be able to reload a previous save, because I already manually saved after the glitch. I emailed Square Enix about it last night, but I haven't heard back from them yet. I cannot keep playing this game while my character is moving unbearably slow. So I guess I'm just done with the game now, and it breaks my heart.

If anyone has any insight into what's going on here, or has any tips, I would greatly appreciate it! I was really enjoying this game but I refuse to start over and lose my 15 hours of progress.....",6,/r/gaming/comments/g160v4/final_fantasy_vii_remake_a_bug_has_ruined_the/

my only disappointment has nothing to do with the game itself.

It's potatoes feed on ultra graphics even though I have a 2080ti and a core i9 9900 k.

or

You’re sprinting ahead of the person you’re supposed to be following and you get to the objective to wait for them to catch up. When they finally get there you’re greeted with their response “About time you show up, i’ve been waiting here forever!”

Aside from non-dynamic responses and potentially bad design, is there a term for this non-linear time scale that seems to exist in games? It seems that time is relative when you observe it from the outside perspective and you always show up at the same time regardless of how long it takes you to do those 37 other sidequests before the end of the game fight.

g20z40,gaming,Help Please 😲! Need A R4 Card For An Old Nintendo DS,"
Hello brothers and sisters of humanity 🙋. A couple of years back I bought a PS3 after years of not having any console since a PS2 that I had as a kid.

Towards the last few years before my PS2 broke sometime into adulthood I sporadically played it. I lost my live for gaming during this period.

I bought a Nintendo DS from my big brother for £25 many years ago with one game, Warhammer. Again didn't play that for years before finally playing Warhammer and completing it.

My plan was to buy an R4 Card at the tine but I never got round to it. It's been years and years since I've had the Nintendo DS.

Rather than sell it for the peanuts I would get for it I decided to finally buy the R4 Card. I'd like to download and play DS games and super Nintendo/Sega Megadrive games via an emulator.

I don't know much about R4 cards. I just now learned that some manufacturers of these cards out something called a ""time bomb"" on these cards. There's ways around that if you do get stuck in that predicament after a year but I would like to avoid a R4 card like that altogether.

What R4 Card would you recommend?

Whats the easiest way to connect a Nintendo DS to a TV?

How to I get back into offline story mode gaming?

I would really appreciate it if you could check out my post entitled ""Should I Get A PS4 Or PS5?"" It gives more insight into my history of gaming and my current predicament of gaming.

I really am looking forward getting back into gaming. Any advice would be appreciated 😊.",6,/r/gaming/comments/g20z40/help_please_need_a_r4_card_for_an_old_nintendo_ds/

I’m not overly fussed about where in time/location it takes place. But I do like the idea of a Viking AC game as all the gods and monsters could be similar to what they were in Odyssey. I seen someone had an idea that Odin, Thor, Loki ect could of been surviving Isu that lived in Scandinavia and the Norse people worshiped them. But seeing an AC in Japan or China would be awesome too

But mainly gameplay wise is what I’d like to hear. I feel like the next AC needs to combine everything that was good about the last games. For example have the parkour from unity, a world similar too origins and mechanics from the Ezio trilogy like having your own brotherhood you control. Also tracking down targets in the open world, finding clues and locations similar to Odyssey and the original AC

I wasn’t the biggest fan of Odyssey tho. It’s was a great Ancient Greece game, but not really an AC game. The rpg mechanics felt out of place in my opinion. If they want to continue with the RPG feel maybe tone it back to what it was like in Origins. Also the camera in Odyssey annoyed me with how for back it was from the character. 

Another idea I like is having the next game 50% animus and 50% modern day. If they did the modern day side good and made it intertwine with the animus I think it would make a great story. Like the protagonist uses the animus to help find pieces of eden while using the bleeding effect to train themselves for when they’re not in the animus. Imagine the modern day being a cross between Watch dogs and the modern day missions from AC3. Probably wouldn’t have Layla as the modern day character tho. Maybe introduce a character that you can loosely customise

* You play as a Roman Legionair/Commander (may be greek but i pretty sure it was roman) and you fight in large battles with your Ai army against another, you cannot controll your army, You cant controll them that much but they will folow you as you are the commander. Also i dont think it was straight 10v10 or something army fighting more like fighting through a level with enemys on the way
* It had couch co-op, i know this because i played it at a friends house
* It was either for the ps2 or ps3 (mabye both)
* It had to be out from 2009-2013 as that is the time i knew/hung out this friend that had the game
* It had to have been releasd in germany

*Levels*

this may help with idetefiying the game

* One of the levels was in a forest it was kind of dark idk what kind of enemys you fought but there were horses , also i think in the level the story was you were ambushed and had to fight of the enemy
* Another level took place in like a castle of sorts that was already kind of destroyed by fighting and what not i remember there were flames and you could burn enemys idk if that part is right tho

g363r6,gaming,Warcraft 3 Reforged Utter Hatred: I don't get it,"So here's the thing. I played Warcraft 3 back when it came out like a million years ago, and never played WoW, so it's been a very long time since I had any involvement with that franchise. I had heard a few years ago that Warcraft 3 was getting a remaster, but it's something I was just vaguely aware of, not something I really followed.

So stuck in quarantine I get a wild notion that I want to play this Warcraft 3 remaster. I do. It's pretty much exactly what I remember just a bit prettier, but it's been so long since I played through the story that it was still fun. I enjoyed myself.

Then I go online and discover that the game is being utterly trashed. Like despised on a ridiculous level. Worst than Fallout 76, worse than launch No Man's Sky, worse than Andromeda, just horribly reviewed and utterly maligned by players.

And I'm stuck in this weird surreal moment, like what reality am I in? I just spent 3 days playing this game, and it seemed fine to me. I mean some of the RTS mechanics are a bit dated by 2020 standards, but it's a remaster of an old game, so that is to be expected. It's an old game with graphical updates, that's what a remaster is right? How in the hell is this game scoring like a 1 or a 0 out of 5 on all these review sites? What horrendous experience did all of these reviewers have, that apparently I had too, without realizing I was having it?

So I read some reviews and as best I can figure, even though the game is like literally almost exactly the same as the old game, just with better textures and models, it is considered garbage because its.....not different enough? The main complaint I found what that some early teaser trailer showed more dynamic camera angles on the in-engine cut scenes, and the final product only marginally changes the cutscenes from the original instead of dramatically changing them? That seems to be the main complaint that everyone was harping about. 

And that's it? That is what caused a game that I walked away from totally satisfied by to be terrible and a laughing stock to most reviewers? Like...their not actually basing their review on what the game is, they are basing it on not being as good as a souped up teaser from a few years prior?

I mean I get criticizing a company's advertising department for that stunt, but that should have no bearing on the review of the actual game? Like famously Witcher 3 got a fairly noticeable graphical downgrade from the first teaser to launch, but only an idiot would give that game a bad review based on that, that has no bearing on how good the game is......right?

I just don't get it. I'm a gamer too, but fellow gamers, I gotta say, as a community, are the most impossible to please juvenile volatile petty customer based on the planet.",6,/r/gaming/comments/g363r6/warcraft_3_reforged_utter_hatred_i_dont_get_it/

g3r10v,gaming,Old PC Skateboarding Game/Demo,"I'm searching for an old skateboarding game for pc I used to play around 2006ish. I was pretty young at the time so memories are, as usual, limited but here are the key features:

 * There was only one level, and one skateboarder
 * The level was some sort of beachfront pier, with a small theme park, section of street and a few buildings
 * Boost pads and some sort of collectible were present
 * A secret room out the back of the map only accessible with some tricky manoeuvring 
 * Lastly, a vague connection to some sort of cereal. Maybe Milo or Nutri-grain

I'd love to find it again,

g4ec5b,gaming,Far Cry Primal,"Any fans? I finally finished this game for the first time ever. Took 3 tries. Bought it at release, played the first 1/3rd or so and got bored and quit. Picked it up again a couple years later and started at the beginning, but the same exact thing happened. After recently replaying Far Cry 4 for the 5th or so time, I decided to give Primal another go and managed to actually finish it.

Combat is just 10/10 fun for me. Nothing more satisfying than hurling a spear at someone 25 feet away. Scenery is beautiful, even though they recycled Far Cry 4s map layout. But where this game lacks is the story. Quite uninteresting story imo, and that's what makes this game hard to finish.

g4eq9b,gaming,Journey - a masterful piece of art,"Yesterday night, once my friends had all gone to sleep, I decided I would finally play Journey. Alone, in the darkness of my room, I launched the game. The knowledge I had of the game leading up to this was scarce at best, but I still had an idea of the type of game it would be. I had seen screenshots and was aware of its critical success upon release. None of this, however, prepared me for the experience of actually delving into this beautiful world. 

From the moment you start you are awed by the landscape; the rolling dunes, the architecture, the sense of scale. Each frame looks as though it has been articulated for the marketing of the product, it is simply breathtaking. One particular part was the section in which you are sliding down a sea of sand. As you pass over it it ripples and glistens as the setting sun paints the world vibrant orange. The most incredible thing however, is that the atmosphere of the game. There are beautiful games out there, ones with far most detailed graphics. Each year we receive more and more graphically demanding games- games like Read Dead Redemption for example. In spite of all this, Journey is the most beautiful game I’ve ever played and it was released nearly a decade ago. 

The atmosphere of the game is what makes this. Alone in the desert, wordless, textless. All that there is is the experience of your character who, due to these absences, is simply a portrayal of yourself. I won’t spoil any of the plot because this game commands personal experience and discovery. I will say that the atmosphere of the game changes drastically as the setting and music shift, linked together through brilliant and dynamic sound design. Just as your character embodies you, you also embody the emotions of the character and are taken along for the journey. 

To summarise, (because I know I could ramble forever) Journey is much less a game and much more an experience. It’s narrative, as you will come to find, is entirely dependent on the person experiencing it and will take on new meaning for each player. It is the most beautiful game I have ever played. My breath was taken away every few seconds as my senses were flooded with an awe inspiring visual and audio symphony. Upon the game’s conclusion I found myself crying and frankly I’m still not sure why. Never in my life has a game hit me so hard, said so much without uttering a single word. 




Hi all, sorry if some of my thoughts there didn’t quite make sense. I was intentionally very vague because I believe that any information about the more nuanced details of the game would detract from the experience on your first play through. If anyone reading this has played the game I’m sure they will understand why that might be. 
Some additional advice that I will wholeheartedly offer to anyone who is thinking of playing Journey is as followed: 
- if you can, play the game in a single sitting
- you absolutely must wear headphones
- make sure you are alone, or at least without anyone talking to you 
- try to play in a dark room

I know those sound quite didactic but please trust that Journey is more art than game. To all PlayStation players out there, you owe it to yourselves to experience Journey, especially while it is free. 

If anyone would like to discuss it with me further feel free to leave a comment below or private message me. Thank you so much for reading.",6,/r/gaming/comments/g4eq9b/journey_a_masterful_piece_of_art/

g4yueu,gaming,Castlevania essential games,"Hi r/gaming!

I recently was watching Castlevania series on Netflix and the series lore intrigued me, so much that I want to get into the series. The whole medieval story, Dracula, the Belmonts lore just so good.

What I am looking for is not a full on journey of playing through over 20 games (as I understand there are a lot of games) chronologically or by release date. I am more of a story guy, who prefers lore, drama, plot first, although I can appreciate good gameplay.

I have a couple of consoles, please suggest games which are available on the following: PS3 Slim, PS Vita, PS4 Pro, Xbox One, Switch.

So I’d like to take your suggestion. Which 5 games are essential to get the most of the Belmonts’ story, for a newcomer, available on the consoles I own, and has great story/lore?

No Spoilers please, but I think that is a given.

THANK YOU!",6,/r/gaming/comments/g4yueu/castlevania_essential_games/

g5mtrb,gaming,idea for a game,"you are the last person on earth. you wake up, check social media, and curiously, there is nothing new, anywhere. the game starts. you look outside--empty streets. you are hit with the reality that you are the last person on earth. no one dead, everyone just vanished. no apocalyptic disaster, everything is intact and quiet.

the game would have a long-term effects mechanic. for example, you could go to the shelter and free all the dogs, but in a few years you will have to fend off feral dogs. if you don't, the poor things will starve. OR you could find a horse trailer and bring them to a big ranch, but you would have to care for them with 10 bags of dog food every day.

there would be a timeline of events. in five days, wild animals would start going into the city: coyotes and deer during the day, bears and such at night. in ten, the infrastructure would shut down. this would be signaled by a cutscene of the toilet backing up. infrastructure could then be restored by going to locations to turn them back on, kind of like far cry's radio towers. this would only last three days, however, so the player would be encouraged to survive without it.

there would also be a library mechanic, in which you go to a library and learn various subjects, such as animal husbandry (pet wolves!), vehicle maintenance, farming, fishing, weapons training, and medical care, among others. you would spend the day in the library, and leave with that skill tree leveled up, with five levels total. watch out, however, because when you leave night will have fallen, and dangerous animals will be about. you can use the internet, but it levels you up more slowly and is temporary (infrastructure collapsing)

after many years, buildings fall apart, cities turn to forest, and guns rust. you must adapt to these changes. an enormous challenge would be nuclear reactors failing, so you need to stay away from these places or find a hazmat suit. after a while, bears and cougars will start to get comfortable, and will come out in the day. food can spoil, so you can't just stockpile apples either.

I would also like a nutrition mechanic that stops players from hoarding beef jerky and canned food, lest they get a heart attack. balance calories and stuff. it wouldn't be tedious, though, as you can simply eat a balanced diet.

however, it is possible to fully recover from a broken bone or something in a month, as I want to make the game playable. however, with fully leveled medical care from the library, it can heal in a week and a half.it would definitely suck to sprain your ankle and it be a death sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

what do you think? put any more suggestions in the comments.

edit: forgot to mention weight of objects and grocery stores/liquor stores/online shopping warehouses. you can take *anything,* but not too much, or you will be weighed down and possibly collapse. there would be backpacks, your hands, and vehicles (truck beds, back of cars) as storage.

a cool side quest could be travelling the globe and taking photos at various landmarks (grand canyon, leaning tower, golden gate bridge) and putting them in a photo journal.

&amp;#x200B;

edit 2: projectors. these raise morale, another stat. when morale drops too low, there is the depression/hopelessness debuff. this affects other things, like movement speed, appetite , etc. projectors would be one way of raising morale, and how awesome would it be to play a movie with a cliffside as a screen.

&amp;#x200B;

edit 3: biodiesel. biodiesel would be a fuel source that can be made by the player. gasoline would expire, but the player would keep a car drivable by using a diesel car and making biodiesel. ",6,/r/gaming/comments/g5mtrb/idea_for_a_game/

In the 2017 one post revealed us the history of Half-Life 2: Episode 3 and we all was sad because that make us understand that Valve probably left the Half Life project. But after the Half Life: Alyx ending and the post credit scene, we can know that the script was an alternative history about what if Eli Vance really died. The next Half Life game will show us something different because Eli isn't dead, and that's why Valve bring us the alternative script, because they'll work in something that will change the history. So Project Borealis will the alternative history, and the Valve ""Half Life 3"" will be the official history.

I've seen it happen a lot of times to my friends and even myself. I used to play different games back in old days but after esports surfaced it became the only thing that I'd play and start seeing it as something more than a mere game.

g7hqs5,gaming,"(Question) Racing Sim players, I need advice.","(Edit: I cannot change the title but I am speaking about casual racing. I do not have a PC or a wheel set-up, thank you.)   
I have been itching to play a racing game for a while now. I have been an avid gamer for most of my life. I absolutely enjoyed the old Need for Speed games when I was a kid such as Underground 2, Carbon, Hot Pursuit, etc. I haven't touched a racing game in a while now and I've recently got into the community of JDM cars. My main question is whether to get Forza Horizon 4 or Need for Speed Heat. I've done research on both of them and I've read plenty of reviews, but of course, all the responses are very mixed as usual. I have never touched a Forza game but I've heard amazing things about Forza Horizon 4. From what I've gathered on my own, the general consensus is Forza Horizon 4 has loads of more content, activities, and cars than NFSH. Also, the obvious being that for Forza is more realistic compared to NFS since it's an arcade racing sim. One of my biggest things about a car game is customization, which when doing research comparing the two games in customization, I've gotten a lot of mixed responses. Some say that NFSH has better customization while others say Forza has the upper hand. Keep in mind that even though I really do like customization as well as JDM Cars, I would like to consider all the factors when choosing a game. Anyways I know this is a long post for a simple question, but I would really like feedback and advice from people who have played both of the games, or even if you have played just one, any feedback would be appreciated.

g7ji4m,gaming,Question about controller sensitivity preferences,"I was playing Warzone with a friend today, and when I passed him the controller, he died a lot. Which is weird, cause he’s normally much better than me. 

After a few minutes, I realized my sensitivity was too high for him, and told him he could change it. When he went to adjust it, he was incredibly shocked that I prefer my horizontal sensitivity to be a point higher than my vertical sensitivity. He thought it was absolutely crazy that I would do that, but it’s how I’ve always played games, cause it makes sniping a lot easier (at long distances, you have to change your aim a lot more horizontally than vertically, especially if you’re not on a significant high point). 

Am I really crazy for doing this? Is it that unusual? Or is it just something that comes down to personal preference?",6,/r/gaming/comments/g7ji4m/question_about_controller_sensitivity_preferences/

i tried playing siege for a while but i’m just not good enough at it, i liked the team aspect that reminds me of overwatch and i do enjoy shooters, i’m just awful at them.

so i think i would really like story based stuff (based on playthroughs i’ve watched on youtube of stuff like until dawn, the walking dead, etc.) but at the same time i like team based fighting games. so either works for me.

FF7 - never played a FF game before, nothing against them, I just never really looked into them when I had so much else to play. I hardly know anything about this one as I don’t want to ruin it much if I do get it, but I’m a fan of narrative games and RPGs + I heard this one had quite a cool world.

I remember downloaded it from my android; it was a time management/cooking and serving that type of game. I remember it was specifically about making sushi and then put on the roller and it will auto serve! I think that part is the point. I couldn’t find it anymore :( please help me

g9rsca,gaming,PS4 games that are comparable to some of my favorite 90s games?,"I just bought a PS4 to help fight the quarantine boredom, mainly by playing my buddy in FIFA online. I have not really played video games since the 90s. Back then, I was really in love with this game called Day of the Tentacle (sequel to Maniac Mansion). I also enjoyed Myst, it's sequel Riven, as well as the King's Quest series. I see now that Day of the Tentacle is remastered and available for PS4 and will certainly buy that.

Are there other comparable games on the PS4? Games where you're really just looking for clues to put together and solve puzzles without having to fight other characters/players (I'm terrible at the whole double joystick perspective-weapon thing)? I'd love something humorous along the lines of tentacle or mystical along the lines of Myst/Riven.

What else am I gonna do? But anyway, I was browsing steam, then I realized I had portal 2 and never finished it. So, being my bored self, I continued playing. As I play and listen to Glados, I realize something. I think about what Chell must be thinking, and I simply look up in sadness. I see that there is the light above her. It may be lights, but I like to think that it's natural light from the sun. I think that Chell continually has the opportunity to escape and scale the walls to get out of the wretched lab of aperture science and get back to ordinary life as a human, but I wonder. Why won't she escape? I know it's not a part of the game, but for lore, why won't she leave? She has no reason NOT to leave. She is constantly bullied by Glados, and she had the urge to escape, since, in Portal, you have to destroy Glados to get out.  Did she just give up trying to escape since she escaped, but was just put back in the Aperture Science labs? And I've been thinking. Should I write a small novel about it? I just think that Chell has such a poor life and I wanna write about it. Tell me in the comments if I should write about it as a small novel.",6,/r/gaming/comments/g9vroz/chells_story_portal_and_portal_2/

g5zhzm,gaming,The huge benefit of next gen consoles vs PC,"PS5 and Xbox Series X are going to have a huge advantage next generation over anything a PC can handle.

As a disclaimer, I have nothing against PC gaming, and I game on a PC regularly.

When a game is made for PC, it is made with pretty much every moderately-capable machine around. It has to be able to run on multiple different graphics cards and is also necessary to be able to run on a regular hard drive as well as an SSD. The game devs don't know what kind of hardware you will be using, they want it to be able to be sold to lots of people, so they make games that can be configured to run on pretty much any setup.

This hasn't been a big deal in the past. For now, console games and PC games can be run on similar hardware. But this is about to change.

PS5 and Xbox Series X games will be made with an SSD in mind. This will essentially eliminate load times. It will make it so that long hallways and elevator sequences are gone. The games themselves will be made differently in such a drastic way that if they want to Port the game to PC, huge changes will have to be made in order to make the game accessable to a large audience.

When devs are making games for next gen consoles and making the game with the console hardware in mind, the console will be the definitive way of playing these games. There might not even be a PC version like there usually is because of the drastic difference in hardware and how they made their game.",58,/r/gaming/comments/g5zhzm/the_huge_benefit_of_next_gen_consoles_vs_pc/

This list is based on two things: popularity and industrial impact. We created four criteria to do this:

1. Quantitative Popularity - the numbers, the sales of the game
2. Qualitative Popularity - the cultural impact, non-quantifiable popularity
3. Direct Impact - impact on games themselves, like game design, features, and concepts.
4. Industry Impact - impact on the industry as a whole, like starting a genre.

g5p7hf,gaming,I don't enjoy games anymore?,"I don't know what's wrong with me, but I don't seem to enjoy games anymore.

During the last year I played: Rage 2, Dust, Quantum Break, Just Cause 3, The Outer Worlds, Nier, Gris, AC Odyssey, Quake Champions, Warzone, Gonner. Couldn't enjoy any of these. And I know it's not the game's fault. I kinda liked Celeste, Furi and Blasphemous. I can see that they're great games. But I can't find the motivation to boot them up. Ever.

Borderlands 2 was one of my favorite games of all time. I don't even feel like playing 3.

Nioh was one of my favorite games of all time. I can't be bothered to play 2.

Dishonored was one of my favorite games of all time. I can't find the motivation to play 2.

Never played Witcher 3. I know it's supposed to be one of the best games ever or something, but I'm too scared I won't be able to enjoy it just like all of these other games.

The only games I enjoyed over the last year were Death's Gambit and Code Vein. I was somehow able to enjoy these 2. But again, I don't feel like playing them again. I don't feel like playing anything really.

It's really worrying because I've been gaming my whole life and it's basically my only hobby. I used to be ecstatic about playing, now I get tired of a game in 2 hours and never go back to it again, even if it was objectively good.

I mean take a look at Celeste: Good mechanics, good level design, superb music. But I just never feel like playing it. It's like the reward centers in my brain shut down. It's a nightmare.

Every game feels hollow, even if it's good. And after an hour or so I want to do something else, even though I have nothing else to do. I'd rather go to sleep instead of playing through another masterpiece.

It's crazy. In March 2019 I was playing Sekiro and having a hell of a time. I didn't feel this way again since. I just always get this hollow feeling. It's like I died inside.

I learned some C#. My rationale was: ""If I can't enjoy playing any more, maybe I will enjoy creating them"". But I know I'll never be able to create a game by myself. It's like trying to shoot a movie when you're the screenwriter, director, cameraman, makeup artist and all of the actors. It's hopeless.

&amp;#x200B;

so lately i've been pretty nostalgic and thought about all the games i played as a kid. And then i remembered one specific one i used to play with a friend when i was like 10 years old. We always just said ""let's go play UFO"" and that's why i can't seem to remember the name of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't remember much of it but here's the few hints i have. It was a detective type game, where you go from screen to screen and click on stuff, which then opens a dialoge giving the players hints. The main character was a pretty derpy looking alien that crashed it's UFO on a farm. I think you were able to abduct the animals there. And that's about all i remember xD.

fswbjc,gaming,XSX vs PS5 potential BOM comparison.,"I hear alot of people say they think the XSX will be $100 dearer than the PS5 because it's approx 2tflops more powerful.

I just don't see that at all.
So, both the XSX and PS5 will have the same fixed costs with a bluray drive, 16gb of GDDR6 RAM, power supply, plastic case, motherboard and manufacturing price.

The leaves a potential difference with the APU, SSD and cooling solution.
The XSX has an extra 16 compute units, which would add approx 20% size to the APU over the PS5. The average cost of an APU will be about $120-$140. So let's assume a 20% cost addition to MS of around $25.00 on the APU.

The PS5 has by far a more advanced SSD solution than the XSX, and that tech comes at a price. I would think, that the extra cost associated with the PS5s SSD would be at least $25.00, and possibly alot more. Just look at the cost that equiviant PC SSDs of that speed come in at.

Then there is the cooling solution. The PS5 GPU is going to generate more heat than the XSX GPU due to those clock speeds, and also add into that the extra heat the SSD will have. As such, you would expect the PS5 to need a more advanced cooling solution than the XSX, especially considering how MS has gone with a tower. If Sony go with a traditional console form factor like the PS4, then it will require even more efficient cooling than MS will need with their tower.

So all in all, I dont see any way that Sony is going to be able to sell the PS5 at a lower cost than the XSX, and may even be more expensive. Talk about being $100 cheaper are just fantasy.",5,/r/gaming/comments/fswbjc/xsx_vs_ps5_potential_bom_comparison/

ftomsu,gaming,Cheaters in cs go,"Cs: go is one of the most popular games for 2020!  People who are far from the world of games are familiar with her!  Dozens and hundreds of hours of play are shown in the player profile.  Skins for hundreds of dolars!  Everyone knows this game, but let's discuss the main DISADVANTAGES of this creation!  Many players lack a prime status that allows them to get rid of a certain number of cheaters.  I did not notice a problem in the cheaters because I had a prime, but after losing my account I did the first and realized what a nightmare it was!  Getting the title has become unrealistically difficult!  Dozens of players with software interfere with playing quietly!  And to buy a prime for 12.90 dollars to many, including me, not at the expense of me!  Why can't Valves buy and install anti-cheat?  For example, take a well-known anti-cheat ""easy anti-cheat"" yes, it is expensive (you can specify the exact price in the comments) well, valv makes hundreds of thousands of games and want to say that they don’t have money to buy an anti-cheat?  Yes, they spend their money on improving their games, for example, by adding a new operation to cs go, but with this attitude they earned twice as much, and Gabin himself is in the top 15 of the richest people on the planet!  They don’t score on their audience, but they don’t want to meet us!  I believe that valve created the legendary game and yes it has been around for 7 years, and all cs go (1.6, sourse and others) have been together for 20 years!  And for all this time, the valve could not make a normal anti-cheat?  This is even funny !!!  The game turns into a garbage dump of cheaters!  And valve needs to solve this problem before they lose their entire audience!  Thank you all for your attention!  With you was Mazurov Pasha.  Sorry for the shortcomings!",5,/r/gaming/comments/ftomsu/cheaters_in_cs_go/

ftoswp,gaming,How to balance gaming and life,"What are your gaming habits like? Do you guys have a routine or do you play whenever you feel like it? In light of this quarantine season, I have a lot of free time, and I can just play whatever I feel like. But I've been getting gaming burnout from doing NOTHING except gaming every day for close to three weeks so far. This kinda reduces the joy and immersive experience I get from playing the games because I end up wanting to just rush through them and be done with them. It's mostly because I'm on holiday rn so I get to wake up pretty late, around 1-3pm, so it's just routine for me to game after I finish my lunch and shower. Then game again until dinner. Then game after I finish dinner until I go to bed.

So I wanna ask how do y'all keep from burning out + manage your time to study/work/socialise while still being able to game?

Edit: whenever I get bored, I try to occupy my time to do other stuff like reading or coding. But I always end up thinking of the gaming I could be doing eventually. And then I go back to gaming.

ftz96u,gaming,Does this glitch where texture loops onto nothingness have a name? (hard to describe),"So there's this glitch in many 3d games that's very hard to describe, so I'll do my best. It happens when the camera views an area that has no textures, such as the void under game maps. Now usually you'll just see a black or blue void of nothing, but sometimes the game doesn't know what to show. Now keeping the camera still shows nothing, but when a texture is in the camera's view and the camera then moves, the texture essentially gets pasted on top of itself, but slightly moved in the opposite direction the camera turns.

&amp;#x200B;

Example: If a character is in front of a camera turning clockwise in a void area, you'll see the very left side of the character freeze, then get pasted over and over, overlapping itself sometimes hundreds of times, kinda like when an old windows error message creates an [error message chain](https://fossbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Windows-error-1200x675.jpg).

- Is an online PVP game
- Has currency that can be transferred between players 
- Has the ability to gain in game currency through market trading and not actual playing 
- Ideally is F2P

TIA!",5,/r/gaming/comments/fumq8v/video_games_with_live_markets_like_in_fifa/
fun6tj,gaming,Mini rant about the state of AAA games and For Honor,"There's way too much clutter and bullshit, it finished downloading completely a full hour ago and I've only fought one enemy so far, it took another half hour to download a patch in game on my PS4 during which time I couldn't even play single player and now I'm starting to a battle pass that it dumped me on after the ""earn multiplayer"" fight

Compare that to playing absolver, a niche and almost dead devolved digital souls like game, you launch the game, press X twice then regardless of internet connection you're in the game, no ifs not buts no bullshit distracting from the game itself

fuu8kp,gaming,"Recommendations for a game similar to Overland? (For PC, Switch, or Phone)","I found this game [Overland](https://store.steampowered.com/app/355680/Overland/) the last week and love it. I've beat it a few times already, though, and was hoping someone knows of any similar games. 

Game Elements I like:

\- Turn-Based. I make a move, enemy moves, then my turn again, sort of like playing chess but there are small tasks to do and it's not just moving around the board because you are moving obstacles, collecting items, fighting enemies, searching containers, etc. It's also not so automated like Civilization and feels more interactive.

\- Strategy Game - You can collect things and have to strategize about what to keep and what to get rid of as well as where to stop along the route for gas or supplies. A bad choice may mean the next levels are harder because you don't have the tool you need, or run out of gas.

I haven't been able to find any others with this turn-based style that aren't more automated like Civilization or mainly text-based without the visual element. I do like Civilization games, but this style is more active with collecting tools and fighting monsters, so I was hoping someone knows of other games like this.

I'll gladly take other recommendations if you don't know this game, but this one has been my new favorite game in a long time so I'm hoping someone knows others that are similar.

Other games I like seem really random, but all have a strategy element where you have to pick and choose what you keep, search for things that are useful, etc: Myst, Diablo (any), Stardew Valley, Octopath Traveler, Wild Arms, The Last Stand: Dead Zone

Thank you in advance for any help you can give! I've tried googling, searching similar tags, and the recommended related games so far, but haven't found anything close enough yet so I figured I'd give asking here a try.",5,/r/gaming/comments/fuu8kp/recommendations_for_a_game_similar_to_overland/

fuynww,gaming,"The Chinese government is trying to control the freedom of speech on a Taiwanese server. This makes the Taiwanese publisher going on a war against the Chinese parent company. Now, a ten years-old MMORPG is going to shut down.","An almost ten years-old popular MMORPG, 劍俠情緣三(there is no official English translation) is going to shut down because the Taiwanese publisher refuse to ban the players on its server despite the Chinese parent company told them to do so.

As many know, April 4 is a memorial day in China when people would visit their deceased or ancestors graves. This year, the Chinese government had decided to dedicate this day to those who perished in the pandemic, especially to Dr. Li Wen Liang (the whistle blower of the virus outbreak). The Chinese government has order all kinds of entertainment be shut down for the day, including many websites, and online/mobile games. This inevitability affected all the Chinese games released by Taiwanese publisher in Taiwan. Many publishers have chosen to obey the order from their Chinese parent company to avoid punishment/commercial conflict, but there is one exception.

網銀國際 is the Taiwanese publisher of the MMORPG, 劍俠情緣三. They have decided to use a three-hour maintenance to avoid further sensitive issue between its Taiwanese players. The Taiwanese players, still feeling insulted and uncomfortable by the forced political decision, decided to leave comments like ""Yes, sir, Chinese Wuhan Virus"" in the public chat. The first player who had left the comment received a 10 years ban by the server. It was found that some Chinese player used VPN to cross the server when they heard  players were doing this. They screenshot the chatroom to report it back to its parent company on Weibo. The parent company, 西山居, was furious and decided to ban the player directly without the programming of the publisher.

When players were aware of this, they started to spam the chatroom with the same message which resulted in more and more bans. Eventually, all the chatroom channels were closed.

The parent company then issued an announcement on Weibo, demanding the Taiwanese publisher to punish all of the players who left messages about ""Wuhan Virus"" ,""CCP"", and ""protect freedom of speech"". After this blew up,  the Taiwanese publisher decided to end the contract and shut down the Taiwanese server. They strongly protested what the Chinese parent company/government had done and wants to protect the freedom of all the players in Taiwan. They were not afraid to shout out that Taiwan is a country.

This all happened over one night (just then). Now, all the players in Taiwan are calling the publisher a ""true hero"" and ""big brother"".

The following link is to the biggest gamers' forum in Taiwan about the fiesta (however, it is in Chinese).

I'm not really a guy who cares much about cheating in general but I have a lot of friends who get turned off quickly from games if they cant manage their anti-cheat.

My question is that isnt it possible to put in the EULA that getting caught cheating could cost you a lot of money? or other penalities that could make cheating less prevalent or atleast force work-arounds like VPNs and stuff atleast making it harder. 

Year after year games slowly die and sometimes the reason is that anti-cheat doesnt really work the way its supposed to, and those who develop hacks are in general one step ahead of the game. But if you got fined 1k€ if you got caught cheating and they found out your identity, wouldnt people cheat less? Isnt the EULA something they decide themselves what they want it to contain or are there general guidelines that prevents something like that to be a thing.

I’m currently using a iMac (21.5 in screen from 2020 with OS X EI Capitan vision 10.11.6) but it’s old and crappy and I’m starting to give up on it. It freezes, crashes my programs, and won’t let me use a lot of my software anymore because they require newer software and if we update the computer it won’t work. I’ve been trying to figure out what kind of computer to get, and I thought the gaming community would be the best people to ask about good computers.

So, I’m a writer, but I also play computer games (off Steam). I use photoshop, animation software, and video editing software, so I need a computer that can handle all that. High memory, 2tb of storage would be ideal. Nothing too small (size wise), I have long fingers and small laptop/keyboards are uncomfortable to type on.

My husband doesn’t want to get another Apple product, so I’m trying to find a windows product. I’d prefer a laptop, but I’m open to desktop suggestions too.

I don't think any other franchise has consistently delivered fresh and exciting ways to play their beloved world they've built. With such a great lore behind each game. 

I remember as a kid I used to go to GameFAQs and print out the in-game documents just to read the story and piece it together.

fxw5g8,gaming,What are the central morals that the Ace Combat series tries to convey? What is it even about and why does it even matter outside of flying missions?,"I'll make this as brief as possible. If this doesn't make sense without additional context, then play the Ace Combat games yourself, as they are a fine addition to your gaming library. The games are known more for their gameplay than story, though several of the games heavily push story and the results aren't that great, due to bad writing IMO.

\*TL;DR. The Ace Combat games have incoherent ideologies and Aesops they try to convey that contradict each other and make no sense, even within the same game. What is the point of the different stories? What is the overall moral arc to the games that are heavily narrative and character driven?

\*Human losses are considered terrible. Not having human losses is also terrible.

\*The military is bad because it causes aggression and destruction. The military is good because it counters aggression and destruction. 

\*Violence is always bad. Violence is always justified if you're the one doing it. 

\*Nations are bad. Not having nations is also bad.

\*Corporations are good. Corporations are bad.

\*Fighting your own countrymen is a tragedy. Fighting against your own countrymen is noble. 

\*Nukes are seen as the ultimate evil because of the death they cause. Nukes are seen as the ultimate good because they act as deterrents that prevent large wars. Both points fail because the games handle WMDs poorly.

A bit more context:

Ace Combat 2, 5, 6, Zero, and 7 are all aggressively critical of nationalism and go to great lengths to show that the military is bad, conflicts exist because countries exist, and that nation-states are the cause of everything that is wrong and the source of all moral failings.

Ace Combat 3 takes place the furthest in the future, in the 2040s, where artificial intelligence and corporations rule. Nations have collapsed and this is considered a sign of moral decay as nations were seen as the primary source of morality, directly contradicting the morals of the other games. Here, technology has taken out the human element and as a result war becomes routine even though it was already extensively established as routine.

Ace Combat 4 is a bit refreshing because it's just flying and doing missions. It has a story, but it's weaker and doesn't slam you on the head over and over again with self-righteousness like the other stories do. There aren't even any important named characters. It's the most ""video-game"" of the series, so it is left out of the moral Aesop.

fy1bsr,gaming,Royal summons to find a game,"So when i was a kid and i finished school, i would come to my step-father's shop, eat there, do my homework (naaah jk i never did my hw), and then play on a PC. My step-father wouldn't let me install any ""heavy"" games, so i'd play a lot of friv flash games.

 Me and another friend of mine (imma call him Petros) really liked a particular game. It was a dragon-themed horizontal shooter, where you controll a flying dragon trying to shoot other dragons and obstacles. In the end of each level, there was a boss (which i recall was pretty difficult). I think it had 8 stages, and the last stage had you fighting against all previous bosses, and then a mirror, or a doorway (not real clear to my head).

 The game was a pretty standard shooter, it had a money system, along with several upgrades to your projectiles, HP of your dragon, etc.

 So Petros and i really enjoyed that game and would often come to my step-father's shop to play it (looking back, we propably bothered the man a lot). 

 So after so many years, i got a little nostalgic and decided to see if they still had the game on friv. Unsurprisingly, they didn't, they had removed a lot of other games from their site. So i just googled ""dragon fyre"". No results. ""Dragon fyre game"". Nothing. ""Dragon fyre friv"". Still nothing. I tried to find a list with all previous friv games but no luck there either.

 At this point i started questioning if this game ever even existed, and all this was just a conjouring of my imagination. So i called Petros, and he told me he remembered the game, and he was also pretty sure it was called ""dragon fyre"". 

 So you have all been summoned by thine lord, thothunter, to assist me in finding ""dragon fyre"". Your spoils shall be plenty (not really) and your glory, eternal.",5,/r/gaming/comments/fy1bsr/royal_summons_to_find_a_game/

https://preview.redd.it/c26s8d6m9yr41.png?width=1362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69ef3fabbf76e80bcce8f9110337f540d852d86d

https://preview.redd.it/m1vtgadn9yr41.png?width=1671&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fa4abf809ec53611059503e32ac5ef65d3c32fd

So, as you can see on the map, there is a room marked with an eye symbol, which is supposedly located behind the 'Top Secret' room (the left '!' mark on the map). I believe there is a secret where the eye is but there is no door to that room in the 'Top Secret' room, nor have I found a button or anything like that to open said door (strangely enough there is a barrier that you can pass through to get into the 'Top Secret' room but to my knowledge the barrier serves no purpose). There are also 2 pictures on the side of the map which could be hints. Here is another 2 pictures just to the right of the original picture which matches one of the patterns from the first picture but one with a rat and one with a man behind it. Maybe it means something?

https://preview.redd.it/h5x5slco9yr41.png?width=1261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea2b153c6b68d21e9b0bed14174161edc4ffc322

Now here's the real kicker, I found a gap that allows me to go underneath the map (somewhere i'm not suppose to be..... probably (sry devs!)). When under the map I found this....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***(Potential spoiler below...maybe i dunno but just in case)***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t9lsfwcp9yr41.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31fb9be1c884e04de5434707fdbde40ac8bccd1f

&gt;!So yea, there's a plane where the 'Eye' room should be, don't know what it means but its there. I also looked at the back of the 'Top Secret' room and from what I could see there is no room at all behind the 'Top secret' room, although there is another room to the side of it. I was also able to get inside the other '!' mark house from below the map (its the middle '!' mark on the map from the first picture) and there is nothing inside it, it's also very dark in there so I might have missed something (picture below).!&lt;

https://preview.redd.it/q5ty7ivq9yr41.png?width=1281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72e68a572e4fd3d57b9cfb6c57192f07d55d1eac

&gt;!Maybe the plane is just a left over asset or maybe there is a secret to be found, either way this is as far as I could get and have hit a dead end so if anyone else can solve this mystery let me know!!&lt;

&gt;!Also, just for visibility sake, I did try to post this twice in the Valorant subreddit (both with and without the bug/exploit) and it was removed without a reason both times which leads me to think that I may be on to something, or maybe they just don't like me lol.!&lt;",5,/r/gaming/comments/fybww9/possible_new_secret_in_valorant/

I mostrly like FPS (TPS are good as well) or GDR games, i'd rather not spend to much for a game unless it can really offer me a ton of hours of playing (let's say, i could spend 70 euros for a Skyrim-like game) and was considering the purchase of The Division 2, being it only 30.

This new update allows you to engage in the world of Publix 76 in a way you couldn't before.

Patch notes ver 4.06.20:

Added wearable item to inventory mask. After much feedback a new item has been added into the game to counteract the ""DeathCoof"" debuff players will no longer be banned for using outside tools to lessen the effects.

Added wearable item to inventory Glove. We noticed players were having trouble engaging in behavior that revolved around the ""DeathCoof"" debuff, glove has been added as a preventative measure to slightly nerf ""DeathCoof""

New player event added. PubTec is proud to bring you an ongoing event to celebrate our senior members!!! 2 days a week we will be rolling out our ""BoomHume Bonanza"" in which player hitbox restrictions will be lessened as to allow more players into the event area, to combat networking connectivity issues due to the increased player count during peak times a npc has been added who will cough on players and disrupt them giving them the ""DeathCoof"" debuff which requires a trip to the hospital to cleanse.

New General chat tech. To combat ""DeathCoof"" there will be a deafening air raid siren noise followed by instructions to stay out of the AOE of ""Coofers"" every 30min to prevent forum complaints about the ""DeathCoof"" mechanic as well as directions in the game world as to best avoid ""Coofers"" \*Path finding issues have been acknowledged and will not be approved in a later rollout\*

Due to complaints of a nonexistent majority regarding difficulty item spawn rates and locations have been decreased as well as randomized to increase player retention.

New item and passive buff issued to store front vendors. The ""CoofBegone"" shield has been implemented at all stationary vendors in shops in the gameworld to combat the issue of vendors accidentally being applied the ""DeathCoof"" debuff leaving several vendors missing from their normal and secondary locations. ""CoofBegone"" adds a 1.99999% resistence to ""DeathCoof"" \*Plans to issue ""CoofBegone"" for secondary npcs will not be implemented due to their higher respawn values.

New ability added for the ""Cler-i-K"" class. ""Hideforfearofpotentialdeathofselfandthosearoundme"" has been implemented as a supplementary measure to the mask and glove items. Many players who chose the Cler-i-K class have reported concern due to the 3rdParty use of the mask and glove being banned. To avoid concern over DRM the Publix 76 team has implemented the ability to craft as well as purchase mask and glove due to cited player toxicity. Each player shall be granted 1 mask in their inventory slot.

Thank you all for the feedback since the ""Coof Heard Round The World Update"" the implementations haven't come too late, we assure you we at Toddthesda inc have been counting our microtransactions up until the very last second before it was too late. We at Toddthesda greatly tolerate our wide and vast playerbase and pride ourselves on being your only real option at this point for many of our slightly valued playerbase.

New ability for the Foreman class. ""Intimidate/Threaten"" has been given to the Foreman class to give them more of an upperhand in duels against the Cler-i-K class to supplement the ""TerminateEmployment"" and ""Eh throw some cold water on em"" ability.

Any players using the ""Whistle"" exploit shall be perminently banned.

fzk7ia,gaming,Xbox One X or Xbox Series X,"Hello! I know this question may have been asked many other times, but I was looking for input from other people. My family currently has an Xbox One. I have been thinking about getting a new Xbox to take with me to college in the fall, and was looking at the Xbox One X which is now on sale for $299 (quite a steal imo). However, I know that the Series X is coming out this holiday season, and is quite a bit more powerful than the One X. I know it’s a pretty generic question, but do you think it would be worth it for me to buy a One X right now, or should I wait for the series X?

 I also have heard that Microsoft will be releasing their games (Halo, Forza, etc) for both consoles, but hadn’t heard whether third party game developers will be doing so. Does anyone know whether they’ve announced this, or the likelihood of them releasing new games for the One X as well as the series X? I am leaning towards buying the Xbox One X now since it will save me some money, and I don’t necessarily need the very best console, but was wondering if it would make sense for me to buy one now considering that game developers might stop releasing games for it. 

I appreciate any answers. Thanks",5,/r/gaming/comments/fzk7ia/xbox_one_x_or_xbox_series_x/

WoW isn't my thing, ESO was alright I guess but I never felt like I had any clear goal that I was working towards so I quickly put it down. Destiny 2 was similar in that regard. Didn't much like neverwinter or DDO either.

I absolutely love playing games where I always have a goal to grind towards, and mmo seems the perfect genre, but every one I have tried seems to either lack actual mechanical skill beyond ""push these buttons in these forgiving timings"", or they lacked a compelling direction for me to follow in terms of a goal to work towards, and as I've failed miserably in finding one myself, I figured this would be a good place to ask.

g05vm5,gaming,[Suggestion] Mass Effect is great and still warrants a playthrough,"If you were gaming anytime from 2007 through 2012, you definitely remember Mass Effect being huge. But enough time has passed for new people to come into gaming, so they missed Mass Effect's heyday. Because of that and because Andromeda was met with lukewarm reception, I think it's a good time to suggest the series.

Mass Effect 1-3 was to video games what Star Trek and Star Wars was to television and cinema. It's an epic space-opera that left a lasting impression on the industry. One devs still take heavy inspiration from.

Interesting thing about the series is how the first game can carry over to the next. With many other RPGs, the developers will just make a canon ending with canon choices. That's not the case in Mass Effect. Every choice made in the previous game is carried over to the next game, so if you start with 2 or 3, you're missing a huge chunk of the game. This effectively makes the entire trilogy one giant game.

The combat in each game still holds up, however in the first game it's a bit clunky, but 2 and 3's combat was made into pretty decent shooters. Even if shooters arent your thing, you can choose certain classes at the beginning of the game that changes how you'd play most third person shooters.

Though the combat is good, its actually secondary to the dialogue and social system. The player can make decisions during conversation with almost any character, choosing certain options can give you points to the game's moral system, which will unlock special dialogue options later in the game. I like this part because you can talk an enemy down and they'll surrender, letting you skip a whole combat section of the game, and that same character will show up in the next game and tell you why they did what they did, and maybe give you something to help you on your journey.

You build a crew in each game with well fleshed out characters. Between missions you can converse with  your squad mates and build relations with them, after a while you can go on special missions with them, take them on dates, and romance them. I'd say this is really what makes the game so special.

Though many have came close, Mass Effect 1-3 is still a one of a kind game series that all RPG fans should give a try. Even of you're more into JRPGs, because I feel ME is the perfect balance of American RPG and JRPG.

Also, you can start with Andromeda. You'll just miss some references here and there.",5,/r/gaming/comments/g05vm5/suggestion_mass_effect_is_great_and_still/

FIFA, Madden NFL, NBA Live, and NHL games often performed better and had more features on the Genesis than on the Super Nintendo, and they were some of the killer apps for that console.

However, when it came time for the SNES and Genesis to retire and the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Sega Saturn to hit the scene, it did not take long for EA to abandon Sega consoles. Saturn versions of EA games were often subpar compared to the N64 and especially the PS1 versions, and were a lot fewer and farther between.

When it came time for the Dreamcast to hit the scene after the Saturn's premature retirement, EA straight up refused to support the console with its lineup of games. Sega had to create their own 2K Sports brand to compensate for the loss of EA Sports games, which they later sold to Take-Two Interactive (who also owns Rockstar Games) in 2005.

g0gykb,gaming,My thoughts so far about COD:MW,"**DUE TO THE FACT THAT POSTS ARE DISABLED IN THE SUBREDDIT /ModernWarfare IM POSTING IT HERE ( contact me if needed to be removed or deleted, Thanks!)**

Hello all,

First off I hope everyone is doing fine during this weird period!

The reason I made this post is to express my mixed feelings about the new COD:MW and find people who are pro - COD:MW aswell as contra- COD:MW and tell me why yes or why no. I also wanne know if people think the same as me or if its just me who's too perfectionist about one of my favourite shooters ( besides Counterstrike \^\^)Ill first start off with informing you abit more about my gaming history with the Call of Duty Series.Ive been playing COD since the very beginning, started with COD1 then afterwards started playing multiplayer on COD2 ( the first COD MP experience \^\^) and i was hooked from the start.When COD4:MW came out thats when shit hit the fan with my gaming habit, with a total of 65days+ playtime on COD4 alone, 50 +- days playtime on COD5:WAW and about 40ish days on COD:MW2. Also reaching 15th place on the global leaderboards for Free-for-All and 75th place worldwide on gamebattles with my team. That being said I can only say that ive gained enough experience and knowledge throughout the years of playing to know what im talking about.

I was super excited when I heard a new COD:MW was going to come and best of all its was gonne be made by imo the best game developer in the COD series: Infinity Ward.Now after playing it a few months im started to develop mixed feelings..**If you as a developer gaming company have almost 17years of experience making FPS games then this is not what I expected from the game. Sorry.** I cant believe that Infinity Ward would launch a game thats filled with bugs who **aren't** getting fixed ( now **+- 6months** counting from launch )Ofcourse any big online MP game (wether being MMORPG/FPS/..) will have its baby bugs in the game wich developers will fix and the game will ( hopefully) indeed will get better by time.

**But as a company who has 17years experience in the branche I personally expected that the game wouldve been 95% top notch developed by the boys from IW and ACT, the other 5% are the small baby bugs that need to be filtered out of the game.Sorry to say Infinity Ward and Also Activision but the bugs who have been in the game from the beginning are still there!!  Bugs in the classes/camos, wether its recieving your beloved Gold camo,  like I experienced yesterday when finishing the new sniper SKS but I did not recieve my gold camo. How is it possible that when the new season hits the community it allready starts off with a big bug on your new Marksman Rifle?Is that a lack of testing before launching or a lack of care? cause lets face it money is now probably filling the bank accounts from the develops like never before and people will continue to buy the game and all its extras with or without bugs..**I made a **quick fictive calculation** based on an average active playerbase of lets say +-20million of the grand total of 50million players. And from the 20million active users lets say half bought the battle pass without the bundle ( just to keep it easy ).So 10 000 000 x 9,99€ ( Im from Europe therefor the calculation in Euro) = **99 900 000 MILLION EURO just from season 3 battle pass..**Add Season 1 and Season 2 Battle Pass and your roughly looking at **300 - 400 000 000 MILLION EURO from Battlepasses only.**And in the calculation we forgot the most expensive purchase of all, the game itself ( wich costed me +- 50€ ). 50 000 000 x 40 euro ( dont know the retail prices in other countries so i took a tenner of my cost) = **2 BILLION EURONow first to clear some things, I am not an hater or a boycotter nor jealous at what the developers earn at all** ( money cant buy hapinness so :p ). Im completly the opposite. Always loved playing Call of Duty and I will probably be loving the game untill im elderly and in a weelchair just killing some enemies on mi old days with my grandchildren :) But what frustrates me is knowing they earn a tonload of money but bugs arent getting fixed, they bugs just keep coming.. Thats where my mixed feelings are coming from, I have the feeling that it aint about the game/community/love for FPS etc. anymore but just for the tons of money they earn with it and thats what sickens me!**I would be ashamed knowing I earned what 2.5B? in such a short period knowing that my game has been bugged from DAY 1 and we are not fixing/ wanting to fix it...**

&amp;#x200B;

After countless updates ( some daily ) going from putting in new gamemodes at 7am in the morning to removing the same gamemodes a few hours later. Or adding another 10 packs with emblems operators etc at a quite expensive price IMO. From launch day untill now you arent able to fix for example **the bugged friend list** area on the game? And the continues **Network errors** going from error 54 until error 26281 wich fade for maybe a week and return back to make your COD:MW experience abit more stressy.**The continues party bug** wich varies from: f.e A party of 6 man searching for a lobby gets disbandened or disconnected at random moments, Everytime one party member leaves while the search engine is looking a match it gets bugged and youll need to redo your search.Another example is 3man party searching for a game\*\*,\*\* game starts, you choose your class and you realize that its just your 3man party against a full team of 6man and nobody is joining to forcen your team ( **although you guys made an thankyou banner for the 50th million user of the new COD:MW**)

So what I make up from this is that in an community of **50million players** there are not even **3 players** who want to join our lobby? And now that the world is in quarantine and the playerbase is booming cause of the various lockdowns across the globe it still takes about **5-10minutes** to find a proper lobby ( **even if youre a 1man party..)** and if youre lucky you'll play a full game with no friends or yourself disconnecting at random moments .

You could say that maybe the disconnecting errors are a cause of me or my fiends internet connection ,buut 4 days ago I had a technician from my internet provider come to my house to check if the problem was coming from me or from the game.. The results are that **my internet connection is completly bugless,** with a **download** peak of **100 MBps** and average between 80 and 100 mbps and a **upload** average of **12Mbps + an open NAT TYPE** so it aint my internet connection causing the errors for sure.

The last problem I'm gonne talk about ( I could fill another page or 4 but I dont wanne bother you guys with all the text. Afterall its Sunday eh ;)) is the advantage of PC players compared to console players and in depth console players outside America like me for example.I personally don't mind playing against PC players knowing that due to their hardware ( processor,graphic card, ram and mouse + keyboard ) they have an advantage in how quick they can react to an action compared to console players. But it puts my skills to the test and im determined to show them I can beat them with a controller haha.

But what I do mind is when me and my friends are playing during the night against mostly americans, that the \*\*people who live closer to the servers will be in advance to us living far away from America.\*\*The communication with the servers from where we live is definitly alot slower, and add on top of the faster communication a tower pc build with a proper decent graphic card, 16 or 32 gigs of ram and a powerfull processor, keyboard + mouse and a monitor wich displays 144 Hz and youve created the impossible to beat player for a console player from our regions..  ( selective crossplay is an option maybe? so you can choose between PC and Ps4 )

**So now I come to the end part of my post and I just wanted to say that Im quite dissapointed in the developers and hope that they will fix all bugs soon! ( looking at the community page of COD:MW there are alot more bugs than I mentioned above )nAlso I hope that Im completely wrong about me thinking its now money over community!!!If so,  youre losing a loyal soldier to the Call of Duty series..**

# And keep in mind Infinity Ward &amp; Activision that without the community there would be no game!

Treat them right!

g0l5db,gaming,"An old turn-based, 4 elements strategy video game that i need your help to remember","It was a game with 4 elements and is played on a board. The things i can remember are that:

• The mechanics of the game is that it has units on board that if you place 3 in a row they get harder to kill, get more damage and range.
• It can only let you move one unit at a time.
• It is pretty old, but not really ancient.



Miniscule details and things i dont remember or aren't sure about:

• This might be wrong, but as i remember, the units are not 1 hit, but instead have health.
• There's a small chance that it may have had a point and click story and that the mechanics I've described are duels with characters you encounter.
• Had a small robot character.
• You can choose to duel anyone from the menu.
• Was on windows.
• I think it only let you move OR attack in one turn.
• Could've been anywhere from 2008 to 2011.
• Small chance it's somehow only 3 elements
• Might be a red herring but one of our pc's used to have a game center where you insert coins and it'd let you access the games ?? i Think it was a bear logo

Things i absolutely don't remember: 
 
• Anything about the name.
• Publisher
• Exact year made
• Names

Im pretty new to gaming and have tried a few different games but find i have a pretty specific type that i like to play and just lose interest quickly on games not in that style so im looking for recommendations on other games that are in the same genre 

The games that ive become addicted to are Skyrim, Witcher 3, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Pillars of Eternity.

They all have a very sword and magic fantasy style gameplay and are generally more primitive/nature style landscapes. Ive tried Vampire the Masquerade a bit as well and liked that but not as much as the others. Im not a fan of turn-based games either. 


Ive had Baldurs Gate, Dishonored, and Tyranny reccomended to me but havent looked into them yet.
Does anyone have any recommendations that are the more sword/magic/decision/rpg that arent modern styles (like spiderman or deus ex) or turn based? I know this is a shot in the dark but i figured if anyone would have ideas it would be you guys.

Games that I loved playing in the past:

Singleplayer:
GTA, Witcher 3, pretty much all star wars games (before EA), all AC games except Odysee, all Mass Effect games.

Multiplayer:
Wow 1.12-4.4.3, Halo, League of Legends, Rust.

I basically have more fun reading news and watching YT videos about a game than playing it myself. I now have this enormous backlog of games I want to play and I can’t do it because they all seem so...blank. 
I can’t genuinely have fun with any game unless I play it online with my best friend (i.e. FIFA, Apex etc) and it’s ridiculous because I’ve always spent thousands of hours playing single and never had any problem with it.

But the more I play, the deeper I get into this amazing experience, the more I think to myself how much it's spoiling flat gaming for me. Like, for the longest time I wasn't one of those ""VR is the way forward"" guys, feeling that flat screen gaming and VR can co-exist... but I don't know man, I can't imagine the disappointment I would feel now if Valve announced Half-Life 3 tomorrow and it wasn't a VR exclusive.

Truly, all either Microsoft or Sony need to do is come out tomorrow showing off a headset as good or better than my Odyssey+ and make it clear that VR will be a priority going forward and they have my preorder. I mean, can you imagine if Sony unveiled a Cyberpunk 2077 VR port for PS5? My god.

It's really quite sad to me how much Microsoft doesn't seem to care. Which is odd, because of their push into the VR space with WMR. Like, I guess I could understand their lack of enthusiasm given the tenor of the VR market before Alyx -- but afterward? The whole game has changed now.

Anyone else feel similarly or are there folks out there who are on the opposite side of the fence, as in they played through Alyx and are totally fine with pancake games for another generation of consoles?

Seriously, every time I watch a Cybperpunk 2077 video these days a part of me is saying, ""as much as it will hurt to, you should wait for the inevitable VR port and experience its world and story like THAT first"".",5,/r/gaming/comments/g1lgpt/after_alyx_im_choosing_my_next_console_based_on/

g1z9s4,gaming,Permanent Games?,"So, people have started talking about the possibility of a Cities Skylines 2.  This has me thinking.  See, I'm a build-type gamer.  I want to be banking effort toward some large and permanent goal.  Multiple-run gaming isn't my thing.  I'm looking to build the perfect City, or make the perfect Final Fantasy VII save, or make the best raid healer on the server.

Nowadays, that's not really tenable.  Let's take Cities Skylines as an example.  I have been working on a city for, well, years.  Even as they released DLCs and such it became painstakingly aware that any progress I made would have to be some kind of temporary thing.  There would never be an ideal outcome, as the circumstances were changing.  Furthermore, the new installments usually don't port old saves and files.  Essentially, the game companies are shaking the etch-a-sketch for me, without me really wanting that.  Even with MMO's, it's just a matter of time before the playerbase dies to a point where the game is dead.

And sure, I could continue trying to perfect a niche old version of a game, just like I can put painstaking effort into keeping a save file alive on SNES cartridges if I want to keep an original Final Fantasy 6 save.  But we're rapidly reaching a point where there's no reason for game companies to continue doing this.  Games which want to update or have DLC can do so, and there's never a reason to put out a hierarchical sequel the way games have been.  Why does there need to be a Cities Skylines 2?  Can't they just *update the game*?

Furthermore, shouldn't there be some kind of area left for **permanent games**?  Like, a game that the developers put out, and only patch to fix bugs, not to actually change the game functionality?  Something which players can be assured will be the only installment of the franchise, or which will at least be a linear progression of story or something?  Something which players can be assured will always be ported in the same version, without being updated or changed?",5,/r/gaming/comments/g1z9s4/permanent_games/

g2v1dl,gaming,What i would like to see in crysis remastered,"1. **a REAL** remaster, aka something like modern warfare 1/2 remasters or the crash/spyro trilogy, aka changing the game up to be more in line with current gen games, with new technology and new techniques used in order to create a better looking game over all, i would like at least for the game to look equivalent to HUNT: Showdown. just please do not do a ""bioshock remaster"" or ""any ubisoft remaster"" where you just change the resolution and call it a day
2. a Stable experience, this is mostly for consoles, but please make the game run at least 30 fps, the crysis games unfortunately do not have a good record but with consoles like the xbox one x and the ps4 pro should be able to run it at atleast 30fps but hunt showdown shows a steady framerate with uncommon frame drops, thatll be fine.
3. a performance mode, again with the xbox series x and ps4 pro, i would love to see a performance mode, with stuff like resolution scales, decreased graphical settings in order to achieve a 60fps mode, im sure someone will tell me that its impossible or something but since RAGE 2 managed it with an open world environment with quite a bit of destructable and movable objects and plenty of fast paced action.
4. don't ignore the improvements from the sequels, ""eh, the sequels sucked, eh"" whether you liked them or not, the sequels did improve quite a lot such as much improved controls, better animations, both first person and AI, movement ( i guess i can see that sliding and mantling would change the game drastically and may not sit well with some people)
5. better A.I. Just like with the previous point, this one may change the game up too much, but the A.I. in crysis 1 is dumb as all hell xD

So , i think that pretty much sums everything i would like to see in the remaster of the game, what do you think? will it change the game too much?

anyways, ill be happy with anything to be honest, while i would like to see these things, i am aware that Crytek is kinds struggling financially, but it would make sense that a remaster for a game that revolutionised graphics should be more than just a res boost.",5,/r/gaming/comments/g2v1dl/what_i_would_like_to_see_in_crysis_remastered/

I also spend thousands of hour making levels for Team Fortress 2 and that time was just a blizz. I loved making levels, I rarely ever finished any levels and I released even fewer.

I just loved the creative process of making something and I've been making levels since Duke Nukem 3D (yes I'm old).

And now, we have Half-Life: Alyx and whenever a HL game is released my brain instantly goes back to all those thousands of hours of creation. Sadly there is no level editor yet, and even if there were there would be no difference since I don't own any kind of VR headset yet so I can't actually play the game.

But I will try and buy a VR-headset sometime and I will play HL: Alyx and I will make levels again. I just miss the creative process. Not many games nowadays give you the ability to create levels anymore and I really miss that part, even if it was years and years since I created anything in a game.

I just wanted to share. Stay safe everyone.",5,/r/gaming/comments/g32vqb/im_so_incredibly_happy_that_halflife_alyx_is/

I want to purchase 5.1 speakers system for my PC but I'm not really an audiophile, so I have some questions which I hope someone can answer. I'm going to use it mainly or onlyfor gaming, I never play on loud volumes, playing in a 14 square meters (150 sq. feet?) room, and all I'm actually looking for is the best surround sound that I can have on my budget.

So I'm looking at these three:- Logitech Z-906 THX- Logitech Z506 5.1- Genius SW-HF 5.1 4800 v2

Now the questions are:

1. the Z-906 seems the best, but will I really know the difference? Or is it (in my described case) just burning money? Should I stick to one of the cheaper ones? Or maybe there are some other speaker systems that you recommend?
2. I'm currently using the integrated sound card on my mainboard (can't really remember the model, I think it's MSI \[insert letter and number here\] Gaming.

I'm currently stalking a stock website to see when the switch will be in stock, because it's been rather elusive as of late. At first the main reason for not getting a PC was the price. But then I realised I'm not gonna be buying spec crushing games. And after some tinkering I realised that a 300ish PC will run the games I want. So now I could also technically get both. But the switch could take ages to reappear. And my next payday is a bit a way. So do I wait for a switch to show up, then but the pc later. Or buy the pc and get the switch later.

g3zzpl,gaming,Reverse Engineering Anti-Cheats from Cheats is Too Reactionary. Why not hire cheat builders?,"It's a simple thought, to me, which means I'm probably not looking at it right. I'm here to have my impressions of the following scenario corrected. I'm *nearly* certain someone here knows way more about this than I do. 

Gaming, Billion Dollar Industry, has a multi-million dollar issue in cheaters. The game publishers and developers are faced with the issue of putting out a product, then defending it from hacks and cheats based on that product. 

The anti-cheat programs (and programmers) have to deal with new iterations of data manipulation so often that they're constantly playing catch-up. It's almost always exploit first, people buy the cheat as fast as possible, then reactionary patches and updates. Ban waves and press releases. 

Then it starts over.

Then a multi-millionaire CEO says, ""Let's put out an ad in the shadowy corners of the internet. We want cheats first for a bunch of games, and we'll pay a premium for them if they go undetected - but we only pay cash in person."" 

They could effectively jack up the market price for cheats, and adapt faster with patches ready as soon as people start yelling about it. This puts them in a position where they can turn the sword around on the builder. Join the team for the anti-cheat, or go back to your previous lifestyle, or we could always rat you out. 

Boom. Cheater bought, god bless capitalism, everyone's happier. Someone gets a career, CEO looks smart, gamers have one less cheat builder to worry about. Anti-cheat gets better. What could go wrong?",5,/r/gaming/comments/g3zzpl/reverse_engineering_anticheats_from_cheats_is_too/

The character was running from them. The colour scheme of the inside of the place I remember was orange but it isn't restricted to this. The ending is the character lost the camera footage of everything that occurred or something and he just left.... like I said its vague so just put horror games that are similar to this and all games that faze jev has done. I can understand you might not want to but please do this for me.

Now that is finished, and the wheel is gathering dust in a corner and I feel guilty about it. I tried to continue playing city car driving, but I don't find it entertaining.

I also am not much of a gamer, I don't have lots of hours to dedicate to this.

The game is grindy as hell its not Genuinely fun until level 50. I suggest going to r/market76 for good weapons once you hit level 50. And the atom shop is the biggest problem it’s no longer cosmetic only you can by repair kits, scrap kits, and the scrap bot that picks up things around your camp. Its a fun game now I think once the bugs are fixed it will be better. If you are thinking of getting the game you should but expect more destiny than fallout it’s way better than it was.

It only makes sense to add a little help aiming while using a controller, plus the only time aim assist kicks in is when you initially ADS. Every pc player thinks that aim assist works like aim bot, nope aim assist just puts the crosshairs on the enemy’s body and from there it’s up the player to follow the enemy’s movement with skill, for example if he strafes you have to move the thumbsticks side to side, the crosshairs aren’t simply just gonna follow the enemy without you doing anything. The other thing I don’t understand is why is it that pc players want crossplay with console players? I mean if you’re that good then why not just stick to lobbies full of K+M players instead for wanting a “easy” lobby full of disadvantaged controller players and then call them bots once you killed them. Console players don’t want to crossplay with pc because of hackers and pc players don’t want to crossplay with console because of aim assist, so wouldn’t it just make sense for everyone just to stay in lobbies with their same platform?",5,/r/gaming/comments/g67i1k/lets_discuss_something/

g7b7t0,gaming,LF Base Building Survival Game,"Hi all,

Im looking for a new game to play with a small community/clan I have established.

Im looking for something similar to the ARMA 2 DayZ mods but a bit more updated. I loved base building with the ideal of survival and going to loot materials. The other thing I loved was it was always ongoing unlike games such as Rust where there are regular server wipes so it felt very short lived. Im more than happy to put hours into a game with other players to grind a solid base.

Wondering what is out there that:

- has base building mechanics, the more modifiable the better
- is online multiplayer
- has PvP and PvE elements
- allows teaming/clan work
- does not wipe!

I will be interested to see what people think :-)",5,/r/gaming/comments/g7b7t0/lf_base_building_survival_game/

This is my first post and hope this is the right spot to post this kind of question. I recently picked up Persona 5 again after not playing for a while and falling back in love with this game. I've restarted and just finished Kamoshida's palace. I heard so much about how P5 Royal is really worth paying the full price again. But at the same time I also been really wanting to play FF7 Remake as well. I guess my question is do I buy P5 Royal before continuing on or just use the money to buy FF7 Remake after I completely finish P5. 

Is it really worth picking up P5 royal if I already have the regular P5 game? Should I just get P5 Royal and wait to buy FF7 Remake later in the future when they \*hopefully\* port it to PC. I know P5 probably wont come to PC but there it is more than a likely chance FF7 Remake will. 

I would really love any feedback or any suggestions for people who have played both games.",5,/r/gaming/comments/g7kd42/i_need_help_choosing_between_ff7_remake_or_p5/

I'm trying to do this inexpensively, and also need a setup that won't take up a ton of space as the room I rent is small. I have a macbook laptop that can handle almost nothing. I have enough space for a pc or console + a small monitor on my desk, and I'm weighing options such as a PS4, getting a used PS3 with a lot of games. I was really interested in the Switch because I have enjoyed past games of Zelda when I had a Wii (my only gaming system), but it's sold out everywhere. Here are some games I've enjoyed in the past, mostly played at friend's places:  


Resident Evil on PS2  
American McGee's Alice (from when I owned a PC)  
Silent Hill on PS2  
Zelda Windwaker and Twilight Princess on Wii  
Borderlands 2 on PS4  
Sayonara Wildhearts on PS4  
Skyrim - definitely my favorite on this list  
First person shooters like Call of Duty, except that I recognize if I play a bunch I feel stressed  
Red Dead Redemption  


I'm really interested in Beat Saber because I love music, but it seems like getting it means getting an expensive VR system.

Most games' easy modes aren't quite easy enough for non-gamers in my opinion... Especially after having watched my wife struggle through a number of games on easy mode.  HZD's easy mode is actually easy and accessible for my wife and it's been really cool to watch her play and enjoy the story.

g7zyct,gaming,"What are the strangest, weirdest and mysterious gaming glitches that have happened to you growing up while playing video games?","Personally I had 3 gaming glitches growing up that have stuck with me and I think about from time to time.

1. Super Mario Bros 2 (NES) - Playing this as a kid I remember you drop in a dream world as soon as you start the game. You do this by dropping in through a door. Well somehow playing with Peach I was able to press up before I dropped and I entered the floating door. I went into the ""dream world"" where the game turns everything dark/inverted. This happens when you drop a potion that you find throughout the game and make a door appear. When you enter it, it is all dark. But I have never heard of it happening in the door in which you drop from, in which you drop into this environment. It happened to me in which I entered said door and dropped into it. I tried and tried to replicate it again to no avail. Who knows if I dreamt this or not lol.
2. NBA Jam (Sega Genesis) - Me and my friend had a sleepover, we had the bright idea to beat the game with Air Dog. He is a secret character that you unlock. The game would not let us save and continue with a special character so we had to play with him non stop, all night. Well me and my friend started fighting over the control in one of the games and somehow mashing the buttons, we brought up a blue screen with a message on it, it was about a paragraph of text. I don't remember what it said, but I do remember it was some kind of a message. We kinda got freaked out and turned it off lol.
3. NFL 2k (Dreamcast) - There was a play in the endzone in which my player fumbled the ball. The way he fumbled the ball really got me mad. They went to go tackle him and missed but were able to knock the ball out ever so slightly. Anyway I went to go watch the replay and I slowed it down, speed it up etc. I did this more than usual. When I went to go replay it again for like the 20th time my player did not fumble. I was like HUH? I replayed it again and again and he was not fumbling, the other guy who went for the tackle him was still in the same position, but his hand went through the ball. The ball did not fall out. I exited the replay and the game counted it as a touchdown lol. I was dumbfounded.

I started the Witcher series with the enhanced edition of the Witcher 2 for PC. On top of being graphically jaw dropping, one of the things that really stood out to me after all of these years is that the choice you make on which group to side with when you leave Flotsam will **COMPLETELY** change most of the next part of the game. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you choose to side with the humans, your time is spent in the army campsite where you can find plenty of side quests and interesting things to do. 

If you choose to side with the Elves/dwarves, you will go to Vergen (I think thats the name) where there are a plethora of side quests to complete and (if memory serves) a lot more real estate to explore, including a mine. 

Granted, if you choose to go to Vergen you will eventually find yourself in the army camp for a brief time as the main story progresses. The opposite is true also if you decide to ally with the humans; you will be involved in the attack on Vergen. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's not really good with the quick-reaction hand-eye coordination required to play action games and Japanese RPGs are a little too 'anime' for him.

If there was something similar to Metal Gear without any action parts, I think he'd like that; basically a fetch quest where you have to search various rooms and do some light puzzle solving. I do know there was a King's Quest game released a few years ago, but what else?

Is there anything like that nowadays? If not, what might those old adventure games have evolved into?

EDIT:

Thanks for the comments. I forgot about all the Telltale games and there *are* point-and-click adventure games still being made. I guess since it's not that popular of a genre though, almost all the Telltale stuff is licensed IPs to help generate sales(?) and AAA studios aren't about to drop $500M making games like Metal Gear or Final Fantasy VII Remake without any action, lol.

I was trying to think of something a little less point-and-click, but at the same time not too action-y. I think turn-based RPGs might be where it's at nowadays. I'd just have to find one that's not *too* Japanese. There was a game for the PlayStation 2 called Summoner that I think would fit. It was a turn-based RPG, but if you were good with timing, you could 'chain' your attacks together.

g8gt8w,gaming,I'm turning Death Stranding into a TV Show.,"Hello guys,

I've been recently finishing Death Stranding for the 3rd time and as I played I couldn't stop myself to make the comparison with what's going on today.

I also thought that it was such a shame that so many people would miss out on what the game had to offer simply on the fact that they didn't own a console or didn't have 60 bucks to spare.

I strongly believe that now more than ever, its message should be heard. There are so many connection that we can make with the current situation and the moral of the game is just so fitting that I think it could touch home in each and every single one of us.

I've then digged on Youtube and basically all I could find was some sort of effortless cutscenes upload with recorded gameplay that would kind of break the pace of the story and the immersion. Some others cut all gameplay from the video, plain and simple, which makes the transition between one cutscene to another quite difficult to follow. There are also a lot of dialogues and scenes that could be ""avoided"" for the sake of dynamism.

To that extent, I've decided to do my own editing of the Death Stranding story and upload it as a TV Show.

Each episodes requires about 7-10h of editing. I'm running through every sequences and carefully handpicking what should be kept or not. (The first episode was quite easy to do because there are a lot of stuff to keep as it sets the base of the story).

At the moment, I've uploaded 2 videos. I aim to release one every week.

You can see the type of edit that I did by following this [link](https://youtu.be/Tp0iXZ7sshg).

You can watch the first and second episode following this [link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C_qvKHQStU&amp;list=PLisf_ed7CK0BWNeo6_uS_h5BB7J6PNvv5)

I've initially posted on r/DeathStranding but for obvious reason everybody there played the game while my goal is more to widen the audience and help people discover the beautiful message behind the game.

Obviously, I'm not taking any credit for the footage as they are all KP &amp; Sony property. Also, I'm not really after fame or anything like that, I've enjoyed doing these edits. I'm just the messenger.

Ultimately, it's up to you though and if you don't want to bother that's cool however I think it's a good opportunity to watch a good TV Show with the people you're spending the lockdown with, it worked out for me :-)

I hope you'll enjoy this serie.",5,/r/gaming/comments/g8gt8w/im_turning_death_stranding_into_a_tv_show/

Its verse is measured in the breaking of bones, and its story is swollen with bodies ripped asunder.  Explicit graphics, explicit language.  No repetitive dance track.  This is the movie I wanted to see so many years ago, only in live action.  I hated the original MK live action films, but this one piece of animation has redeemed the franchise.

g9c04q,gaming,"Beat Dead Space yesterday, started 2 today, a pet peeve........","Why in the hell was isaac given a voice? One of the things i liked about Isaac Clarke was that he never had input on things that happened. He just sorta observed. I don't mind him speaking when spoken to in Coms with people, but he has input and jargon about fucking everything.

I mean, could his voice have been something minimal used at key points in the story instead of having him say stuff like ""holy fuck"" and ""hang on, i'll fix it""?

It's a dumb rant but i found Isaac better when he didn't talk or have input on stuff. Made things like his run ins with the Mad Doctor all the more personal and disturbing.

Not only that, the few interactions Isaac did have at the end were incredibly impactful, for obvious reasons. The emotions and intensity of the situation at that moment were palpable and mutual for everyone involved. Both the player and Isaac had the same exact thought in mind: enough is enough, you're dying and i'm getting off this rock. Him saying it out loud would have ruined the mood for me.

Like i said, i have zero problems with Isaac having a voice. But when he comments on every single thing and to every single person, it just starts to feel like he's a generic sci fi protagonist talking about everything and junk. It's annoying.

On a side note, i'm happy for all the free weapons and suits. Now i can spend more on power nodes and ammo instead of rationing everything.",5,/r/gaming/comments/g9c04q/beat_dead_space_yesterday_started_2_today_a_pet/

fxrne2,gaming,PC or Console?,"Hey all, I'm sorry to be 'that guy' to raise this kind of question, but I used to be a pretty hard core gamer, started on PS1 and was with PS up until my brother and I got an Xbox One years ago. I grew up on console and had never really gamed on a PC before, but after being out of the gaming, umm, 'game' for years, I've been wanting to get back into it. However, a lot of the gamers I know and follow are on PC and I've heard a lot of hard core gamers say that PC is ultimately better than console, even though of course they both have their merits and downsides. Since I would be dropping down about $500 on either, and I don't really have a preference, what would you guys recommend?

g8xbbx,gaming,Why am I so bad.,"I’m 17 and I play a lot of video games especially recently because of isolation and I can’t help but notice I’m terrible at every game I play.

I have sunk 1000 hours into csgo and I’m still not out of silver

100 hours on aim trainers like kovaaks and recently 50-60 hours in aimgod and I can’t seem to get any better at aiming

200 hours on the new call of duty and I’m still yet to get a win on warzone where I don’t get carried with 1 kill while my teammates have 15+ I have had the game for a while now and my kd is still 0.75

I had 500 hours in fortnite and I had to give up because I couldn’t even build to the standard of other people despite practicing(idc what you say the game was fun a couple of seasons ago)

150 hours in apex legends and still don’t have a win

I have tried dota and league of legends and have 200-400 hundred hours in them combined with still little understanding of how to really play the game and spend most of my time respawning  

700 hours on siege and I’m still copper 

 I can’t seem to improve at all even though at one point when I was playing FPS games 247 I was practicing for 2 1/2 - 3 hours a day before playing 

I’m genuinely thinking about giving up in video games permanently or just playing more enjoyable multiplayer games that aren’t competitive, at one point my dream was to play something professionally but as I got older that dream slipped away and I’m now In year 11 in Australian college I’m starting to feel like completely giving up and pursuing my other passion in design.

g0dfay,gaming,The Final Fantasy 7 Remake is absolutely amazing,"It simply is. It's not without flaws, of course, but they seem so minute compared to simply how masterful it does just about everything it does. Most especially the way it brings these characters to life, but also the outstanding boss battles and the great dungeon and environment designs. It's both a complete game and a lavish story with scope and ambitions that really strain all precedent. I'm so glad to have experienced this, because this is absolutely the remake Final Fantasy 7 deserved. If you loved the original game, play this, because it is that game realized to its absolute form. What they are doing here is an outrageous, ambitious and impossible project that could not possibly have succeeded -- and yet it has.   


The  worst part about this game is that I have to wait so long for more of it, but it will be well worth that wait. And the game itself is satisfying, deeply satisfying.",47,/r/gaming/comments/g0dfay/the_final_fantasy_7_remake_is_absolutely_amazing/

g3kn4j,gaming,Why aren't there more AAA games for mobile devices?,"By mobile devices, I mean Andriod/IOS phones and tablets.

The Nintendo Switch is basically an Nvidia Shield tablet from 2015 with 4 GB of shared LPDDR4 RAM. If they can get games like the Witcher 3 and Doom 2016 running on that, I see no reason why modern phones and tablets shouldn't get the same treatment.

Modern phones have more power than the Switch. The Razer 2 phone comes to mind the most, but I'm sure there's mobile chip sets even more powerful than the Snapdragon one used by the Razer 2 phone. They could probably somewhat easily reach PS4 graphics by now, yet the most I've seen come out of phone games is PUBG, Fortnight, and Minecraft. That and some 6th gen games like GTA SA and KOTOR. Plus a few COD rip-offs which do seem somewhat impressive.

Why aren't phones being treated as a mobile PC? Laptops aren't really as portable as the Switch is. With exception to the GPD Win 2, you can't really put them in your pocket and just quickly pull it out and start playing with it when you have some down time. You can do that with a phone, however. Yet most phone games are ass. 

Why aren't developers taking Android/IOS more seriously as a legit platform? Imagine if even Skyrim came out on Android. I'm fairly certain a modern phone or tablet could run most 7th gen games like that, and I'm certain that with some tweaking it could run 8th gen games too. If the Switch can do it, there's no excuse for why phones can't.

The Razer 2 phone can emulate Gamecube games better than the Switch can when in Android mode and using Nvidia Shield clocks. Not every phone is that powerful, but even cheaper smartphones these days are at least on par with the Switch.",45,/r/gaming/comments/g3kn4j/why_arent_there_more_aaa_games_for_mobile_devices/

fxlrxg,gaming,Sony Suspended my Account after someone hacked it and stole $190,"On November of 2019 I received multiple purchases on my credit card from playstation network. I did receive emails about these purchases, and Sony was not available to talk to at this time. 
In order to put a stop to whoever hacked my account, I promptly contacted my credit card company. After the conversation, the credit card company stated they would look into it and in the meantime would cancel that credit card and send me a new one. In the meantime I should pay for the charges not related to this issue until it is resolved and they weren't going to place interest on this specific charge until it was resolved. I quickly change my account's password and set up two factor authentication. When I originally created my account way back on the PS3, there was no option for this. I saw it and set it up immediately. So the problem will be solved right? Wrong.

Fast forward to the end of March this year, and my credit card company looked into the matter and utilized a chargeback. I have since talked to my credit card company and they didn't receive any correspondence from Sony, prompting them to utilize a chargeback. So I get my money back, but then Sony sends out an email saying that my account is now banned. I barely am able to talk to Sony's customer service today and my only options at this point are to pay the debt of $190 or leave the account suspended. There is nothing else that can be done at this point. I refuse to pay for any of these charges that I haven't initiated myself. I could create a new account, but my library would be inaccessible even though it would be on the same system.

I take issue with how Sony has handled this situation on the whole. I have had a similar situation where my steam account was compromised. I did contact my bank, and they were able to work out the situation with Valve. My account was not banned and in the end my money was returned. I have done a lot of reading throughout the internet and have found that this isn't the first time that this has happened to someone, especially on reddit. 

Some people have been in contact with Sony for weeks and eventually got them to relent. However, this option isn't really available to me since I am a medical student currently dealing with the COVID-19 situation. I simply don't have time to contact playstation support continuously during their support hours. I was able to barely contact them today 10 minutes within the support's closing time and frankly got nowhere. At no fault of mine, my account is banned. I went through my credit card company to protect my finances and have gotten nowhere with Sony, even after a period of 4 months with my credit card company.

Sorry if this is a bit scatterbrained, I am now at wits end at how to proceed. All I wanted to do was have this resolved and purchase the Final Fantasy 7 remake to play/decompress over this weekend since I'm off.",43,/r/gaming/comments/fxlrxg/sony_suspended_my_account_after_someone_hacked_it/

g8ugmi,gaming,What should I do. I bought RDR2 and it isn't any good. Can't refund.,"I bought RDR2 on steam and it was super boring. I also lagged so much so it was next to impossible to play even though I met the required specs but even then I have learned I do not like story based games even the online is pretty boring. I had gotten 7 hours on the game but still tried refunding it and explained my situation. They denied the refund request because maximum is 2 hours. What should I do from here I have an $80 game i can't run nor do I have any interest in playing. Is there anyway I can contact steam support and ask them through there and they may be more understanding or something because $80 is a lot and I am poor. Any help appreciated.

EDIT: BIG UPDATE! I took the advice of user u/Akuema and contacted them saying that I dont plan on upgrading and it seemed to have worked! Thank you u/Akuema and to everyone who was saying otherwise I guess I just proved it wrong. With 7 hours it is possible.

2. Stored ammo count in magazines.(reload after one round with a 60 round drum mag, you use up two other full 60 round mags and get back to the first one and only have 59 rounds now)

4. Manually having to clean your gun when it gets dirty. 

5. Jam mechanic that is based on the type of gun and how dirty it is. As well as rng from the ammount of bullets in the magazine. 

6. Weapon overheat and manual barrel swapping. (To clarify, guns like the m249 saw have a quick swap barrel feature that allows the gunner to swap for a different barrel when one gets hot)

g5bd66,gaming,Why did seventh and eighth generation gaming consoles not run at 60FPS?,"First off, let me get this straight, I'm not a PC elitist, I owned multiple consoles and still do.

Before the seventh generation, the standard for consoles was to run at 60FPS.

Then, the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 were released, all of them running at a standard 30FPS (I know, the PS3 had a few exclusives that run at 1080p and 60FPS, like Gran Turismo 6, but if such a graphically good game could run at 60FPS, why not the other ones?).

What was the cause for this? Why did they ""downgrade"" to 30FPS?

Then, the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One were released too; those not being able to run at 60FPS either, even though early statements from the consoles' development stated that they will run in 1080p/60FPS. (I specifically remember hearing a statement that the PS4 was able to run at 240FPS!). The PS4 Pro, and the Xbox One S remedied these issues though, good enough to even play games in 4K. Considering that the PS4 and Xbox One had very strong hardware and computing power, what was the issue here? Why did they decide to abandon their early statements regarding framerates?

For more than 3 years I've been using my dad's old xbox name and now I finally have the chance to change it, but I can only change it once, and I don't know what to make it.

So I'm looking for suggestions. It's unlikely I'll use an exact one suggested, but anything to give me new ideas helps.

&gt; My dad, uncle, and older brother all have ""Evol"" before their names, (our last name backwards) and it's not necessary, but it'd be great if I could keep up that tradition.
&gt; If it's themed torwards a specific game then I'd want it to be Sea of Thieves. I usually only play that and Minecraft. But I don't want a name that only works with one game, so if it is themed, it's best vague.
&gt; I wanted to make it Son of Furrows, (an inside joke), but it's 2 characters too long, and IMO it's not as great without the spaces.
&gt; I also am interested in languages and I've studied Latin, Spanish, English of course, and a little of Chinese, so something around that would work. I'm sure a Latin name would strike fear into my enemies.

Hi  All!  I'm hoping someone here can give me a recommendation.  With working from home right now in NY and also having my kids home, my older  son and I have been playing a little more gaming together when we are  both not busy with work and his school.

We  just played Blazing Chrome, and it's super fun. He likes the fast pace  action, I like that as well, plus easy to start with, and I don't mind  the 16bit graphics as well.  I grew up with the likes of contra so it's a  fun game!

Does anyone have  recommendations for another game like that, where you side scroll, basic  shooter, it can be old school graphics or new, on gamepass?  Thanks if  anyone can help!  This is for Xbox One X.",4,/r/gaming/comments/fsypht/side_scrolling_action_game_recommendation_with/

My specs are:

 CPU: Intel (R) Core(TM) i5-4460 CPU@ 3,20GHz 

Graphic card:  Nvidia GeForce GTX 960

 And an 8 GB DDR3 memory.

Do you think it's a good idea? I'm thinking about medium price range, maximally about 350$ or 330€ for the CPU or graphic card. What should I look for especially? How do I find a good CPU?

Writing to ask a question I’ve been having a very hard time answering for myself, and am hoping you can help me with some new ideas. 

Q: I am a competitive gamer and not a quitter by any means, I lose, and practice, and learn to get better and better. I love the grind of it. I love seeing my progress. That being said I enjoy the competition and not so much the game. I miss the old days of playing games for fun. I recently bought Assassins creed oddisy as a casual game to enjoy because I remember enjoying the first 4-5 games they had made many years ago. I am struggling to enjoy it however, as there is nothing that’s driving me. It feels like a chore and I was wondering how you can go back from a competitive scene to playing for fun? I feel like my options are mess around online and have toxic feedback from others ( which yes I can mute but I don’t play to loose either I just mess around sometimes, but like to communicate and be a team player) or play solo games which as stated aren’t working out too well. 

Maybe it’s the wrong place to ask but any feedback would be very much appreciated as I have so much time these days.... thanks rona.",4,/r/gaming/comments/ftbbdw/competitive_to_fun/

ftguro,gaming,Gather 'round one and all while I recite a tale that will surely send a shiver down ones spine.,"It was a night, not entirely dissimilar to this very same night, in some homes it may be known as trash night, but to me it will forever be known as the night of unfathomable horrors as you will soon discover that more than just trash was taken out on this night.

  At first everything was right with the world and all was well, you see, as usual I had procrastinated all day until I was barely even awake then I remembered to take out the trash, there was more than one bag, some small, some big. I took all of the bagas out and returned back to notice one last bag, so being the stand up citizen I just so happen to be I only wrestled with the descision to take it out or pretend I didn't see it for like a second or two but eventually I did it. little did I know it would be a descision that would haunt me for the rest of my life.

   To fully appreciate this tale of woe one must travel back to the long distant past known as about 2 months prior to the night in question, I think it was a tuesday.

 It was hot and I had agreed to help my mom move some things around in her house, the work was hard but I was harder because at some point while I was moving things around I found a bag with a premo N64 and tons of great games in it and I was itchin' for a fat hit of ol' lady nostalgia.

 Anyway long story short, yeah... The bag with the N64 was indeed the very same bag I would end up throwing out and it pisses me tf off.

This doesn't make sense in the conventional way, so how do these games calculate chance so that this does make sense internally? (I'm aware there will be no one size fits all, but I'm really curious about how different games handle it)

Off the top of my head, I guess a game could:

* Start with a base percentage to cause stun, say 5%, then increase that by the pickup amount, so +100% chance to stun from items, would only be 10% raw chance to stun.
* When the chance exceeds 100%, all hits stun, and for 120% chance to stun, there's a 20% chance to stun for twice as long
* Just cap it out, and ignore all values exceeding 100%.",4,/r/gaming/comments/ftm7g0/how_do_rougelikes_deal_with_over_100_chance/

I think some games on the idle genre often have a good system in which the ads are optional and they reward you for watching or clicking on the ad. For me this is the best way I can think to monetize a game as it is up to the player if they choose to watch the ad.

fubrt2,gaming,I have an idea how to save the Guitar Hero franchise,"I got to thinking. There's lots of AAA games that went mobile, hear me out. I noticed even Activision is on the app store now with Call of Duty. 

From what I understand, the main reason Guitar Hero ended was money issues. They couldn't get the necessary licensing for good music.

Look at games like PUBG Mobile and CoD Mobile, they rake in billions despite a subpar customer experience. The secret trick being feeding on what they call the ""whales"", daft rich people that will drop $300 on a stupid gun skin or gems for Candy Crush or whatever.

There was already several hit games that were basically mobile Guitar Hero. There was Tap Tap Revenge and Don't Tap The White Tile, both of which had actual music in later versions. Then there are some choppy ""create your own"" guitar hero games like BeatMP3. Honestly, I love all three of these games and they seemed to do quite well in their day.

So, here's my thinking: Bring back the Guitar Hero franchise through the app store. This would have many perks that would aid in reviving the series efficiently.

- Possibly, they could save money by obtaining music the same way Pandora and Spotify do, bulk licensing from iTunes, Amazon, and Google

- as much as I despise this marketing gimmick....app store it up. Milk the dummies with a fat wallet. Unlock random songs through some sort of rigged spin situation, which gets easier if you throw them a few bucks for premium or more coins or whatever. Maybe even just straight up in-app-purchase DLC for each song or set of songs.

- throw some ads up there between games, even more money

- play those app store mind games, buy songs, guitar skins, clothes, blah blah blah. Somebody will dump $1000 into it.

- if the game turns out to be a hit, which is almost guaranteed (so long as it's not Guitar Hero Live again...) it could fund the revival of the whole series. Considering how even the shittiest of app store games rack up so much money, *official* Guitar Hero would probably go straight to the top just like CoD did, just because it's official. And considering Tap Tap Revenge, Piano Tiles, and BeatMP3, it's definitely a successful format on its own without the Guitar Hero name

- could do ""Seasons"" like CoD and PUBG do. Every few months make everyone buy premium again...and again, not a fan of that, but anything to fund the console version. Anything.

- if Activision or Neversoft is actually reading this...........***please please please please do DJ Hero also!*** Could be just like the guitar hero one but you slide your finger for the scratches, and the crossfader along the bottom, a knob in the corner for the effects, a euphoria button, and the samples could just have buttons instead of scrolling through them like on console. Throw in some deadmau5, Daft Punk, Justice, Gorillaz, Marshmello, Alan Walker, Glitch Mob, instant hit game. Go down the dubstep and trap road and woo doggy that game would be unstoppable.

- Maybe after a few seasons of them cashing in big time with mobile, they could bring back the original console versions. Worse comes to worse, they could do what Walmart does to maximize efficiency. Support the more difficult products with the ones that fly out the door. Just looking at from PUBG Mobile to Angry Birds, they make **way** more than is necessary to maintain the game, and constantly. Guitar Hero being a shelf game, gets bought once, then you have it. A mobile version would be constant inflow of money, plus all the extra from the whales who splurge. They could probably support consoles entirely based on mobile sales, and still make tons of profit all around.

Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, Band Hero, all of them. It's a golden series and I miss it dearly. An old broken eBay controller and Clone Hero just doesn't cut it anymore. And for us DJ Hero fans, we have nothing but the originals. I'd love to see DJ Hero 3 someday, maybe this could be how.

fuc48z,gaming,Halo MCC on PC - worth it as a first timer?,"I'm a PC gamer, never had an Xbox so I've only played Halo over friends' houses growing up. I generally know the story/lore and think it's awesome.

The Steam reviews for the Halo games that have released so far are pretty mediocre. People are finding the controls clunky on M+KB and running into tons of bugs that they don't think will ever be fixed.

I also won't benefit from nostalgia glasses since it'll be my first playthrough, so outdated game mechanics and graphics won't be charming to me. I worry that all the positive reviews are from people who are rating their favorite childhood game rather than the one I'll be playing in 2020.

I'm not particularly interested in multiplayer, I wouldn't mind checking it out if there's still a playerbase, but my internet sucks and I have other multiplayer shooters I'd rather play.

fuwzf2,gaming,I love them both!!,"

So I've been an xbox only gamer since i first felt that monstrosity of controller that was ""The Duke"" in my big ol ham hocks. The offset sticks, wide spacing and real triggers felt like it was made to help me conquer the covenant. I was hooked and never looked back. 

Every new generation after, i was never in doubt of which system i wanted. It was always a given that i was gonna get the xbox, and almost only for the controller. We all know the exclusives weren't always on point, especially against classics like God of War, Uncharted, or last of us, but it didn't matter to me cause I knew what i liked, and liked what i knew. No matter what else changed with the playstation, it maintained that same parallel thumb stick design that made my fat, white boy hands scream in discomfort. 

Then came this last gen and I of course got my xbox one and eventually the X, and i was happy as a clam. The newest iteration of old faithful was lovely and i never regretted a thing. Then i hear of the newest God of war, a series that I'd always regretted not having access to,  being transcendent and mind blowingly good, and i wonder what I'm missing. Then i hear that the newest spider man game is gonna be a PS exclusive. 

This is a massive blow to me cause I'm a huge spidey fan and it looks amazing. Turns out it IS amazing and I'm shattered. I can't afford two systems so i just have to hope that maybe a buddy will get it and maybe I'll get to plug away for a couple hours, live vicariously through his purchase. 

Turns out fate had other plans. My 9 year old son asked his grandparents for a game system for xmas, and they of course ask my advice. Three guesses what my advice was....

Yeah i used my son's xmas present to finally get a PS pro with spiderman in the house, judge me all you want. 😅
My son is happy as clam, and I'm excited to get tucked in, but there's only one problem. Side by side thumb sticks and that damned playstation controller that has kept me away for damn near twenty years. I'll know it's gonna suck the joy out of my session so i spend almost 2 hours trying to find out how to connect my xbox controller without any luck. 

Im legit devastated, and when my kid finally goes to bed I begrudgingly resign myself to fighting this monstrosity in order to play this amazing game. Beyond first world problems, but they're real to me. 

It takes almost a full 5 minutes and i realise this is not the cramped wrist breaker I've spent my gaming career avoiding like herpes. It's wide and spacious, heavy and meaty. The triggers are responsive and the buttons click in a muted but amazingly tactile way. Even the weird gimmicky touch pad in the middle is intuitive and functional. And the cursed thumb sticks? Don't even notice anymore.  In short not only is this controller not hindering me, it's as good as anything I've used.

I play for almost 6 hours that night and I'm sublimely happy. Not just cause the game is good(and MAN, it is GOOD!!!) but also cause I've finally overcome my twenty year prejudice and now i get to just enjoy gaming.

As this next gen looms upon us, i can finally say I'm unsure of what way I'm gonna go, and i love it.😁",4,/r/gaming/comments/fuwzf2/i_love_them_both/

fuyzrs,gaming,Question to Retro/Vintage Gamers... Maybe all?,"Quick background, I jumping into a new hobby of restoring retro games. Reasoning is, I have recently been diagnosed with cancer and have to make the decision to step away from my job for my own health. I am doing fine but with my line of work I do, and the levels my immune system is at right now, I couldn't take the chance of catching anything else. So I decided to keep my mind and my wallet occupied with some retro restoring.

The initial goal was the take broken machines and restore them to almost new. That means full gut, cleaning/repair of boards, repair of any parts that need attention but maintaining as much of the original parts as i possible can. Everything is going well, I am getting the machines up a running, getting the games to turn on on their first tries. All the good stuff. I only ran into a minor set back that I need your guys expert/personal opinions on.

As most of you know, When it comes to NES/SNES consoles they can take on a yellowing effect due from exposure to UV lights. I believe later models of the SNES fix this by adding something to the dye that they used on the plastic. But, if you don't know what I am talking about just do a quick google search for ""NES yellowing"". Now after cleaning a handful of the NES shells I have, i notice some of them do have this yellowing effect. Which is not a problem I have a solution to fixing this but the problem I am having is... should I? The yellowing give it a real vintage look. It also gives it a ""aged"" look that I like, like you know this system has seen some s\*\*t.

The cons... Some of these console the yellowing is spread evenly. But on others, you can tell the NES never moved a single spot for a long, long time. So you have a corner that is deep yellow, almost golden color, and the opposite side just slightly yellowed if not at all. So it doesn't have the same great vintage look as some of the others have. Other spots like under the lid are not going to see much light as well. Which is fine, because once that game is in the lid should go down again anyways.

Sorry if this was drawn out a little but I wanted you guys to get the full feel. 

So, I guess the questions I have are : 

\-Do you guys prefer the yellowing look?

\-Does the yellowing effect give it more value?

\-Should I just go for the same look for all NES/SNES?",4,/r/gaming/comments/fuyzrs/question_to_retrovintage_gamers_maybe_all/

Ryzen 5 3600

MSI gaming plus WiFi X570

32G Corsair LPX DDR4

No slouch obviously, and absolutely powerful enough to run the '99 classic.

The game is giving me a very low frame rate when certain effects are on screen, such as when I look out the window on Oblivion and see the stars zoom by, or when I fire the shock rifle, or rocket launcher. I tried software rendering but the game wouldn't launch. I need to use 3D hardware rendering.

fvrfhc,gaming,"I never played Fallout games, but I already love that they exist because they expose the new generations to pre-rock music, to the songs of the Great American Songbook!","People exploring popular music often tend to ignore the music and artists of the pre-rock era. Understandable considering how rock changed culture and the musical industry industry in the 50s and 60s in such a radical way, creating the modern landscape in too many ways to count and leaving even the most established pre-rock artists almost suddenly struggling with sells and popularity. I love that the songs of the Great American Songbook, called standards (they were american popular music from the first half of the past century often made specifically for Broadway plays and musical movies, Fred Astaire debuted many of the standards), are finding new exposure with new games, the Fallout is particularly notable for this and that's why I don't even need to play the games to already love their existence! Singers such as Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holliday singing songs composed by the likes of Cole Porter, Harold Arlen, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin and many others. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a HUGE Sinatra fan, I love his voice, his style and his artistry, I fully listened to almost all of his albums from the 50s released by Capitol (the only exception is A Jolly Christmas From Frank Sinatra) and most of his singles. I also love what I have heard from the Columbia era and some songs from the Reprise era too (though from the 60s and, specially 70s onwards, his voice would suffer significant decline, become far rougher and off-key due to him being a heavy smoker). 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To finish my post, I would like to say this for all gamers who played Arkham Knight and listened to the intro song of the game ""I've Got You Under My Skin"", a masterpiece of popular music composed by Cole Porter: if you want more of it, get the album ""Songs For Swingin' Lovers!"" immediately, the song comes from this album. It's a masterpiece of swinging, catchy songs with the fantastic, rich and refined arrangements of Nelson Riddle and Sinatra's voice and performances at his prime! Alongside In The Wee Small Hours and Only The Lonely, it forms the Holy Trinity of Sinatra's albums. The latter two are, though, very sad and slow ballad albums whose style may not be instantly appealing for many people, so I think that Songs For Swingin' Lovers is the best Sinatra album to start with. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P.S.: I love how one of the Call Of Duty games' trailers used Sinatra's ""I'm Gonna Live Till I Die"" song for the whole score of the trailer, it's an underrated song. Also, please, more games with the Fallout philosophy of using the Great American Songbook for the soundtrack!",4,/r/gaming/comments/fvrfhc/i_never_played_fallout_games_but_i_already_love/

Just got the switch lite a week ago, haven’t bought any games yet, which one should I get first? I don’t really care for a deep story or prefect gameplay mechanics, I just want something fun, the two games I was considering the most were: Zelda BOTW, I like the graphics, the areas, the exploration, and most importantly the combat/weapons and Animal Crossing NH, just customizing my own island and chilling there would be great!

fwmxpx,gaming,"New game, Fallout: Across The Wasteland","After F3 and New Vegas there is a new cross-point.

""Two"" games in one where you wont need to leave someone behind or remember old places like DC or for others Goodsprings. This idea comes to this:

You all surely know about Pokemon shield and sword and etc... well this comes to a Fallout where you use your old PJ or from FO3 or NV. If you take your NV character you will go to the other side of the Wasteland where FO3 took place, following of course the last events of NV. There, you will hear everything your other pj did and made, with all your choices made port in order to show it them to you in this new game. Its like messing in someone's else land, but you are that someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

If you take your old FO3 PJ then you will have a new lead to follow after NV events of course in Mojave outpost. There you will see as i explained before, all your other NV pj did and the impact of its choices, making mojave what it is.

(Of course there will need to be an order about that. If you play the NV PJ first, going to FO3 wasteland then once you take your FO3 Pj to NV you will hear about all you did before with your NV PJ)

&amp;#x200B;

At some point everything could be prepared for some DLC (only being available after finishing the main game) that let you play for example as your FO3 PJ IN the FO3 part of the wasteland while your NV pj makes whatever you did on your first run, making THE HELL of a lot of possible ends and impact.  As you all know, war, war never changes.

i know that something like this involves a GIANT budget as well as time as well as a lot of technical and narrative problems that needs to be fixed. But i think that you get the concept. This is a mere concept, and im aware of how hard making this possible is as well as the problems that it would have. But taking the position of this being possible and made, would you buy a game like this? Do you think it would make well in the market?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time on this and sorry for any sintax and/or grammar error. 

PS: If you can, bump this, i'd love to see as many responses as possible. After all who knows if this is real someday... dreams (still) free, right?

fxqtpp,gaming,Welcome To Stadia - Tips &amp; Where to Start,"Hey All,

With the newly announced Stadia Base rolling out right now ([source](https://www.blog.google/products/stadia/try-stadia-free-today/)) I thought it might be useful to impart a few tips for making the most out of the platform, as well as dealing with some of the possible hiccups etc.

Whilst I know this service isn't going to be for everyone, I'd like to at least *try* and keep it succinct enough that those who are interested can get some actual help/guidance, without the need for trolling. I get that you might not like the whole cloud thing, but there are those who do. 

**48 Hour Roll Out**

First thing's first, to create a Stadia account, you simply need to head over to [https://stadia.com](https://stadia.com) or download the Stadia app on your smartphone. From here you should be able to follow the on-screen directions to create your free account. 

If you don't see this feature available to you yet, it's because the rollout is taking place over a 48 hour period. So please, be patient and try again later. More details of this can be found in the initial Stadia Blog post I linked in the first paragraph.

**What is Stadia Base?**

Stadia Base is the free variant of the Stadia platform, where you have access to the same game store catalogue as Pro subscribers, except you don't have the ability to claim any of the Pro games, for free.

Stadia base allows you to purchase the game of your choice, and access it on any supported device, so long as you meet the required internet specifications, with quality settings up to 1080p.

Should you want to play in 4K, with HDR and 5.1 Surround Sound, you're going to need to upgrade to the Pro subscription. **However**, those who sign up to Stadia now will receive a 2 month Pro sub free of charge. This includes instant access to the 9 current **free** Pro games on offer. 

The current Pro games are:

* Destiny 2
* Grid
* Gylt
* Serious Sam Collection
* Spitlings
* Stacks On Stacks (On Stacks)
* Steamworld Dig 2
* Stramworld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech
* Thumper

Also worth noting, that once a game has been claimed, it is yours to keep, as long as your Pro subscription is valid. Even if you let it lapse, and pick it up again down the line, the games will be playable again.

During this Pro trial, you're also likely to add at least another 4 games to your catalogue, as so far the minimum number added has been 2 a month.

**Common Setup Issues**

Some of the more common problems users have faced with Stadia so far fall down to the setup or settings being used. And most are really very simple to fix.

It is imperative that you check you meet the Stadia requirements before you play, otherwise your experience is not going to be an enjoyable one. By this, I mean that if you're wanting to play at the maximum settings, then your internet connection has a different requirement to those who choose to play at 1080p etc.

All of these can again be found on the Stadia website.

Other issues occur when playing over WiFi, and this is a common gripe for a lot of players. The problem here is that everyone's WiFi is different. Different hardware, different ISP's, different homes. 

The best advice I can give you here is a) Use a hard-wired connection where possible b) when on WiFi, be sure to connect to Staida via 5G bandwidth, not 2.4GHz

If you're using a router that allows 'Gaming Priority' then be sure to select this. It should help divert resources to Stadia first. 

**Do I need a Chromecast and Stadia Controller?**

The short answer is no. But this is wholly dependant on how you want to access Stadia and the type of experience you want. 

If you wish to play on your TV, and you don't have your PC hooked up to it etc, then you will need a Chromecast Ultra (it **must** be an Ultra, at this point) and an official Stadia controller.

The Stadia controller and Chromecast Ultra need to be connected to the same network, as the controller connects to the Stadia platform directly via your WiFi router and not Bluetooth. 

You also have the option of hard lining your Chromecast, by plugging in an ethernet cable directly into the power plug itself. If you are able to do so, I absolutely recommend doing this. Ethernet connection is by far the most reliable method of achieving the best results.

You can find Stadia Controllers or Premiere Editions (controller and Chromecast Ultra Bundle) [here](https://store.google.com/product/stadia).

**The Games**

The current catalogue of Stadia games totals 38 titles, ranging from indie titles through to a few AAA's, most noticeably adding the Division 2 and DOOM Eternal to the mix. 

Stadia had notified us that as of this year, they were tracking 120 titles to come to the platform, including a mix of Stadia exclusive titles. I would like to point out that this notification came before any of the COVID-19 pandemic issues were present. And we are now likely to see multiple delays within the games industry. Please be patient, they will still land eventually!

Some of the larger notable games on Stadia include:

* Assassins Creed: Odyssey
* Borderlands 3
* DOOM Eternal
* Destiny 2
* Grid
* Gylt (Stadia Exclusive)
* Metro Exodus

And many more.

**The Stadia Community**

One of Stadia's best features is the community of players, content creators and developers themselves. I haven't connected with so many new players and/or content creators in my entire gaming history, and that spans 3 decades. 

I'd like to point you all in the direction of [StadiaSource](https://stadiasource.com), an unofficial news site for the Stadia platform that delivers a one-stop-shop for all your Stadia needs, from tech tips to game releases, a list of the Stadia content creators, podcasts, forums, reviews...the lot!

It's also worth subbing to r/Stadia where you will see additional content, both official and unofficial. It's another great place to see the latest news, as well as finding other players to add and play your favourite games with.

This isn't ideal when you consider most PS4  Pro games run at subnative 4K resolution. Mincrosoft show off Gears of War Ultimate Edition running at 4K on Xbox Series X (game didn't get a Xbox One X patch) in true 4K by multiplying 1080p 4 times. Most non Pro PS4 games run at 1080p.

fxyp7p,gaming,I seem to not enjoy many genres of games and it bums me out,"Hello fellow gamers. 

In the midst of this healthcare crisis, I’ve been looking for games to play and I’ve finally realised something that greatly limits what I play: I basically dislike any genre that is not a third-person high budget action game. 

I can’t stand first-person games; I can’t stand puzzle games; I can’t stand strategy games; horror; shooters or anything similar. 

All of this is to say it bums me out because I feel a lot of the games that come out — certainly recently anyway — are first-person perspective. Disliking this camera perspective means I don’t play so many of what others view as awesome games. I’m not saying I want to learn how to like them — only that I wish I did.

fygmzm,gaming,just cause 4 review,"I know I am a little late to the party but I just had to write this.

I got just cause 4 free on as a part of Xbox game pass. this has to be one of the worst game I ever played.

&amp;#x200B;

Bugs

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This game has more bugs than features. Sometimes I got stuck inside walls. Sometimes I went inside the ground. And the AI characters never followed me if I changed the vehicle. It was pain Getting them to follow you. Sometimes when you grappled towards choppers you just bounced off them.

&amp;#x200B;

Travel

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like this game is more inclined in traveling than it is in the actual gameplay. It took a lot of time to get from point a to point b. Though it has a large arsenal of vehicles still I suffered. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gameplay

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The developers missed a huge opportunity of making us also a part of the fight when we needed to expand our terrirtories with squads. They should have made us fight a battle with the black hand  to capture an area. They could have improved the game by taking inspiration from far cry 5

As it too has same things like gaining influence, freeing outposts, then after influence was gained, final mission.

&amp;#x200B;

The gameplay was so weird. Vehicles get destroyed if you touch yes literally touch them from another vehicle. You would think that a chopper or a bomber can handle a little jerk but no, as soon I hit the ground too hard , chopper gone

My bomber touched a car? Bomber gone.

&amp;#x200B;

the most repetitive game I have played till date!. destroy generator, destroy turbine same things over and over again.

&amp;#x200B;

The map was very big but nothing to do in it.classic quantity over quality case 

&amp;#x200B;

Story

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Story was half decent. Still I couldn't enjoy it because of the the bugs 

&amp;#x200B;

Controls

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There is no way to change the controls! The controls are so bad. Move your vehicle left with X and right with B not with the sticks. A is not to ascend but to jump out of the vehicle. Countless times due bto my muscle memory of other games I tapped A to ascend and jumped out of the plane. The weak plane couldn't handle it and exploded touching the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

Player

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We are near immortal. In other games nearly 20 shots and you are dead but not here. If you stand in the middle of gunfire then even you won't die. Feels so unrealistic.(even though we have a grappler strapped to our hands )

&amp;#x200B;

Graphics

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Graphics were good but characters' lips were out of sync from their dialogues.

&amp;#x200B;

Difficulty

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Was too easy. Enemies die in 2 shots  (hard difficulty mode)

You die in 200+ shots.",4,/r/gaming/comments/fygmzm/just_cause_4_review/

The problem is I've seen this chip also has an integrated GPU (that I currently do not use) and they both have kind of a complicated relationship. So if you overclock the CPU, that part of the chip is going to heat up more than the GPU. And that other fraction will have less room to work properly (as I understand it).

I am thinking that I may be better served by a wired headset, so I would like to hear if anyone has had both and if the Kraken TE is a worthy successor? I know it has an inline DAC, but if needed, I also have a mixamp pro from Astro that I can plug it into if needed.

The main gameplay focuses on building paths from one point to another, while following the restrictions set by obstacles on the levels. There's also secret collectibles hidden throughout. We wanted to keep the mechanics fairly simple for our first game since game design is waaay harder than we expected.

It's been a lot of work, not only on the game development side, but learning about setting up an LLC, getting an operating agreement, trademarks, promotional materials, and all sorts of stuff you'd rather not be doing so you can keep developing your game. I'm glad a lot of that is just in the beginning, so now we have more time to devote to our next project.

We really would appreciate any feedback. My biggest concerns are if the game is fun, if the tutorial is clear, and if the ads are too annoying. I think the banner ad and the optional, rewarded ads are probably fine, but don't know if the one that drops every 5 levels is excessive. Definitely interested in everyone's opinions.

fzxvq6,gaming,My Brutally Honest Opinion about Bunny Day in Animal Crossing New Horizons,"Okay so there is a lot I have to say about Bunny Day. Let me just say this, its my opinion you don't have to agree with it, I understand if you enjoy Bunny Dad more power to you, but this is just how I feel about the event. So let me just address the elephant in the room, the idea that you had to hunt for eggs everyday leading up to the event was so poorly done. Like you couldn't get any materials from Trees, Stones, and Fishing when all you seem to be getting are eggs.

Zipper the character that you meet the first month tells you that you have to hunt for eggs and then he'll come back on April 12th which is the day of the Bunny Day event. So then now all you've been doing is going around your island hunting for eggs and at first its fun, but then it just got more annoying. Like I mentioned before the eggs were everywhere and you couldn't go without a day worrying about what fish you catch when you have thought of ""oh shoot it could be another egg""

On the day that Bunny Event Happens you go to the Plaza talk to Zipper for whatever reason he acts like you and him never met before and just repeats the same dialogue as before. By now you've already had enough eggs because hunting them on Bunny Day just seems pointless. When you try to trade eggs with Zipper its a long tedious thing to do. You have to talk to him, select what egg you want, select 3 eggs to give to Zipper, and then he gives one. No joke you have to do this one at a time and it took me like 30 minutes just to get the eggs I need to craft the items.

When you finally craft all the Bunny Day Items Zipper, fools you and just gives you a DYI recipe for a Wooden Toy of himself. So then you craft that and you would hope to get a better reward but guess what, the last thing he gives you is another recipe this time for a Bunny Day Wand. At this point you feel like you've done everything and all Zipper seems to care about is you hunting for eggs when really you just crafted every item.

So yeah my experience with this event has been really annoying and just tedious. To be fair the Bunny Day items are cool to have but the event itself was flawed. I hope Nintendo learns from this because there were so many things they could've done better with this event.",4,/r/gaming/comments/fzxvq6/my_brutally_honest_opinion_about_bunny_day_in/

fzyukg,gaming,A gamer in need.,"Hello, Redditors! I hope people are doing ok during these times. I hope to help my mum who I managed to get into gaming on PC quite a while back but hasn't got the hardware to do anything amazing. she has an old MacBook Pro that she has been using to play the likes of Stardew Valley and House flipper on low-quality settings. Today we thought we would try to use our 2013 IMac Pro that she used for DJ-ing. We tried to download Steam and get her playing but apparently the computer can't run Steam. Simply some form of an error message saying that ""There was a problem opening \*Steam\*."" regrettably we tried to follow factory reset instructions to not only help clear the useless files that we no longer needed but also maybe force the computer to update or anything as was suggested on Apple support.

Long story short, the Mac is bricked and can't find its own Disk utility software and we have been trying to get it to just the login screen to download chrome or just make the thing usable. I have checked online for about an hour and it doesn't look like this problem has been raised by many and when it was, it was never answered with a solution.

My mum has been working from home and has been quite sad about not being able to play the games she has bought on Steam. Originally she just shared the games from my library before we realized we can't both play at the same time. So she bought Stardew and house flipper and played on the lowest available settings and took breaks to ensure her MacBook didn't catch fire or anything.

If anyone either A) knows a fix for both problems with the IMac pro (steam and startup issues)or B) is willing to sell/gift a hand-me-down personal gaming laptop computer for her I am willing to negotiate and work to elicit the exchange. She wants to play more games and she's really upset about the IMac situation. As she can barely play the games she wants and would love to play more Steam games.

Thank you for listening, I not only needed to reach out to both see if this issue happened to anyone else but also to reach out to the other gamer's out there who may be able to lend a hand during these isolated and depressing times.",4,/r/gaming/comments/fzyukg/a_gamer_in_need/

Its an online top-down spaceship role-playing game for PC. Its 2-D and the pictures looked similar to something like Rimworld set in a large spaceship. After joining a server you are given a role on the ship, these ranged from captain to janitor. The game had a lot of depth represented through right click menus with few animations. In the podcast (Sleepy Cabin) they talked about griefing and getting kicked from servers. I remember them saying they would pour a bucket of water in the hallway and people would keep running in and falling. I'm thinking the game must have come out/been popular between 2005 - 2015.

g0w12b,gaming,FF7 Remake is a necessary experience,"I remember seeing previews for Final Fantasy VII in magazines when I was in middle school. I calculated how many weeks I would need to save my allowance to buy a PlayStation and the game in order to play it. I replayed Midgar soany times and left my PS1 running for weeks because I did not not budget in getting a memory card to be able to save my progress. My friends who weren't as fortunate would come over to watch me play, day after day. 

This remake is, so far, one of the greatest gaming experiences of my life. The first mission in modern HD visual glory,  the music, the expansion of the human element of the story, the different but satisfying combat; all of it feels so dang good. Surr, it's more linear, sure they have changed up some things in the story. But it all feels so right. The nostalgia is strong, but not overwhelming. There us such satisfaction of a tough battle well fought, of a summon's ultimate attack, of a boss fight so perfectly capping off a chapter.

I was skeptical to hear that they were tweaking the story, that combat was more like XV than the original. But they did it all so well. The only downside is that I have to wait for the rest of it.

If you remember the hype of the original, if you remember getting pulled into its world and loving the story and the characters and the journey to learn more about this wild yet relatable world, then you simply need to play this game.

Then Half-Life: Alyx got released and I completed it twice in a row. 

After that, I first started playing Resident Evil 7. I was so terrible. I almost never landed any headshots and just got stuck with almost no ammo. I completely gave up at a particular chainsaw boss battle.  
""Well, it's a horror game and probably supposed to be extra hard"", I told myself and proceeded to boot up the BioShock Infinite DLCs instead, remembering the quaint times I had with the base game.

Almost the same thing. This time I did land a few more headshots, but I died A LOT. On normal. In BioShock.

g1ziwi,gaming,X box elite series 2 controller review.,"    I wanted to do a product review for this controller series for everyone interested in them. I have owned 3 total controllers from the series (1 first gen and 2 second gens).   I’ll explain in detail why I feel the way I do but let me get it out the way, save your money or spend it on a different high performance controller.  

      The big con about this controller is it’s reliability, the buttons stop responding. It’s a shame because other then that the controller is pretty much perfect. I wanted to like it so bad because of how good it feels when it’s  100%;...but after 3 controllers I’m giving up. 

      First the pros.  The controller feels good in your hands. The controller’s extra button options on the back are perfect. The customization and mapping on every button is everything a gamer could want. Even the case that has a charger built in is oh so sweet. This controller is so close to perfection it almost feels like self sabotage that it’s not. 

      The con is that the buttons, specifically the bumpers; stop responding after very little use. It’s not in the way you handle the controller, it’s because they are build with plastic pieces on the inside where the standard controllers have metal ones. This little difference is what kills the controller. 
       
     I’ve had 3 as I stated before and all 3 have had the bumpers go out. Now granted in the game I play those are my main attack buttons so they are used the most, but that shouldn’t matter. Furthermore; for 200$ the controller should be more sturdy then normal really, or at least not weaker. I’ve never had a problem with any other controller breaking and take good care of my stuff. It’s the plastic design inside.  
        
       After the first controller I had,  (the Gen 1) had its bumpers go out I read online that this was a common issue everyone had. I was upset because I really liked the controller. But when it only lasted about a month or so it’s not worth the money. So fast forward a couple years later and I notice Gen 2 at game stop. After asking the employee about it he assured me that the issues with the buttons going out where recognized and fixed with the new Gen 2 version. Excited but still skeptical, I got the controller with the warranty, a total of 260$.   About month in, you guessed it, the bumpers went out.  So I brought it back to game stop and they exchanged it. So now I’m on my 3rd controller. If I wanted to renew the warranty it would have been another 60$ and I decide to forgo it. If this one goes out Im done with them.  Sure enough it did. Again, a little more then a month has passed, and the left bumper is iffy on wether or not it responds. For the price they are asking I don’t think reliability is to much to ask for, but this controller does not deliver. It is a true shame because like I’ve said, other then that it’s a perfect controller.  

  Sorry this is so long but I wanted to give the full story on these controllers since they are so expensive. They got me twice and I just wanted to spread the information before they got someone else.",4,/r/gaming/comments/g1ziwi/x_box_elite_series_2_controller_review/

g21ngy,gaming,This will probably be ignored however I might aswell post...,"Hey there!

I'm new to reddit so please put me right if I'm doing anything wrong or posting in the wrong place. So due to lockdown I've had alot of time to think about what I want to do with my life. Due to this I've decided I want to make my life meaningful and impact other peoples life on a widespread basis. Also during this time of lockdown I've started watching Star Wars the clone wars tv series. This got me thinking...

Although I may be misinformed, there are plenty of Star Wars based games there are no up to date games that revolve solely around the Clone Wars in an open world like Assassins creed (obviously theres the Lego game!) that I'm aware of, I'll happily be corrected of course. 

Therefore this got me thinking would there be the potential space for a game based around an individual clones that puts you through a story mode. I want the game to feel immersive and people to get the idea of what it's like to be a clone. Obviously this is a base point of an idea and I could go into far more detail of what I want to do. Of course I know Disney own star wars and the possibility of making a game would be almost impossible without the correct permissions. However you have to aim high!!


Therefore I would love it if people would PM me that are into star wars or know how to build a game!

I know I'm terrible at writing, with this most likely not making any sense at all, and it will most likely be wholly ignored, which I don't blame you for, but even a comment could help spark any ideas!

If you've read this far many thanks and if theres any issues with this post please let me know.",4,/r/gaming/comments/g21ngy/this_will_probably_be_ignored_however_i_might/

g2ap0r,gaming,Back into video games after a hiatus and need recommendations to pass time during covid,"Hey guys,

My apologies if there's a thread to ask for recommendations that I missed. 

Like just about everyone else, I've been playing a lot more video games lately due to being locked indoors. 

With the major exception of Red Dead Redemption 2, I've played very few video games the last ~5 years. I also started playing Batman: Arkham Knight recently, but I've done pretty much everything there is to do in that already after only a few weeks. (It is not as expansive a game as RDR 2 but I liked it a lot nonetheless)

When I log onto the Xbox store on my machine, I notice a lot of the games they recommend are pretty darn old. Like, already played them before my hiatus old. I'm not sure if I'm navigating the store properly or what but I'm not seeing a lot of games from the last few years.

Has there just been a slowdown in the industry or am I missing something? I'll totally believe you if you tell me it's the latter; not meaning this post as a diss to game companies or anything...

Anyway, would love some recommendations for games I may have missed, in pretty much any genre. To give you a sense of what games I enjoyed growing up:

- GTA San Andreas, IV (including Gay Tony and Lost &amp; Damned), and V

- Halo CE, 2, and 3

- Battlefield Bad Company 1 &amp; 2

- Modern Warfare 1 &amp; 2; the first Black Ops was okay

- Skyrim

- The first Red Dead, along with Arkham Asylum and Arkham City (my experience with these games is why I chose to play RDR 2 and Arkham Knight as mentioned above)

Any recommendations based on the above? In particular I'd love to try some more recent titles from like, idk, 2016 onward? 

Thanks in advance!",4,/r/gaming/comments/g2ap0r/back_into_video_games_after_a_hiatus_and_need/
g2beg9,gaming,"Mario Kart, Fast RMX, and Grid Autosport are the only racing games worth getting on the Switch.","Mario Kart is the perfect party racing game. The actual driving controls are more arcade and gamey, but I like that. Plus the actual racing skill isn't really important when blue shells are involved.   


Fast RMX is similar to F-Zero, in that if you blink you could very well crash. It's incredibly fast, its environments and courses are both stunning and difficult, and it requires you have Jedi reflexes.  


Grid Autosport gives you the option to choose your racing style, between sim and arcade. It's really the only racing sim worth getting because it allows you to use a Gamecube controller, and its analog trigger goodness. I've had Xbox owners say that the game is harder than Forza. Now ofc, I could change the settings and make it as easy as a Need For Speed game, but that defeats the purpose. I have it on full sim mode, without car damage that is. Also the game doesn't factor in fuel and tire wearing.   


If other racing games allow you to use the Gamecube controller and its analog triggers, then I'd happily play them. So far though, that hasn't really been an option.",4,/r/gaming/comments/g2beg9/mario_kart_fast_rmx_and_grid_autosport_are_the/

g2ppub,gaming,Remembering good games: Silent Hill (1998),"First of all, when i write about ""remembering good games"" is about forgotten good games. In this case is not a forgotten game, just a classic and abandoned one.

We will focus on Silent Hill 1, you will understand why

I think everyone knows Silent Hill, but not everyone played it. It's a survival horror game for PS1 launched in 1998. The story is too great and awesome to make a synopsis, but (as in the post of F.E.A.R.) the wikipedia has a good one:  The game follows Harry Mason as he searches for his missing adopted daughter in the eponymous fictional American town of Silent Hill; stumbling upon a cult conducting a ritual to revive a deity it worships, he discovers her true origin.

Silent Hill has a lot of sequels, but only one that is direct: Silent Hill 3. Silent Hill 2 follows another story, Silent Hill 4 and Homecoming too, the others (Origins and Shattered Memories) are linked to the first one but are not direct sequels. 

Silent Hill 1 is not my favorite (this is Silent Hill 2, which is my favorite game ever) but is the one that most deserves that we talk about it, because if you play SH2 or SH3 today, the mechanics and the graphics are still good, but SH1 has old mechanics, bad graphics (today, because in 1998 they were great) and its quality comes only from the story and some pontual gameplay moments nowadays, in short terms: its dated. And while other games like the classic Resident Evils, Final Fantasy VII, Half-Life 1 and Spyro are getting new remakes or remasters, Silent Hill is just... abandoned. Like i said, it's not forgotten, every gamer who had a PS1 or like old games love and remember this game, but Konami just forgotten this game and the entire SH series.

I'm focusing on SH1 in this post because every game of the series deserves one post (specially SH1, 2, 3 and 4), but mainly because it need a remake to maintain alive this classic, amazing game. But let's discuss all of them too! 

What's your thoughts on Silent Hill series? Which one is your favorite? Do you want a SH1 remake? Ideas for a remake or a new SH game? (let's forget PT to hurt a little less)",4,/r/gaming/comments/g2ppub/remembering_good_games_silent_hill_1998/

g3al0w,gaming,Help finding a game,"SOLVED


I've looked forever trying to find a game before coming here. So maybe you all can help me

This game is a turn based RPG- Xbox 

The whole premise is theres a map that has some areas where bad people live and the area you live. 

You hire whatever four man combination you want to explore the lands around you. As you play the characters get older. 

You can hire a leader, setup marriages, a 3 person cabinet.  

The characters dont really have faces or such it's all kinda sharp shaped characters.  

The enemies they fight, if my memory is correct, all have like purple crystals sticking out of them. 

Again its turn based when you get into the fights. And if I remember correctly theres a button you can hit that goes to the next year. 

Sorry I couldn't give any more information.

I am well aware of teammates who will genuinely throw by inting or dc’ing or whatever but that’s simply out of your control. You must focus on what you’re able to change. Rather than saying stuff like “I died because my teammates weren’t with me” ask yourself what you could’ve done in that situation to prevent that like “was I out of position or taking an unfavorable fight to begin with?” And for games that are 1v1 instead of saying “they’re winning because they use OP characters/tactics” and complaining you need to ask yourself “what weaknesses does their character/gameplan have and how can I exploit that?” These things might seem obvious but it’s truly the best way to improve.",4,/r/gaming/comments/g3drr3/biggest_tip_for_improving_in_any_competitive_game/

I hear these stories of people having the time of their lives playing video games with their friends and other things like that, so I have made a list of things that I want to achieve. I am making this post to ask if anyone knows how to achieve these things. I will be using minecraft as an example because it is just a good example and a lot of things happen in it, though I do not play it much anymore.

1. I would like to become known in a community and be invested in it, like to know who the best and popular players in the community are. I would like to be able to make friends in the community. I heard a story on askreddit about OP joining a small server and making good friends, being invested in it, and such, and had nostalgia about it looking back, and I want to have a good time like that, and I feel like my chance is slipping away as I am 14 years old.  I also want to be known for something, and I know that is broad, but it is something I would want to have done.  Where would I find these communities and how would I have these kind of experiences?
2. I want to play more AAA games, and be able to understand references, but I don't know where to start. I want to one day go to like PAX and cosplay or something but I want to get to that level of knowledge first.  What AAA games should I start with and where should I go from there?

How would I achieve these things, and have you? I know this is a long and dumb post, but any and all reply would be massively appreciated,

g3hwk9,gaming,Mouse and Keyboard on Console- My take,"Nobody asked, but I wanted to give my input anyways. 

I recently watched a video about rainbow six. In the comments section, hundreds of people were saying that mouse and keyboard on console was “cheating”. IMO, it takes a long time to get good at mouse and keyboard. Arguably longer than it takes for someone to effectively use aim assist.

From my own experience, I’ve talked to people that will blatantly flat out say that if you have MnK, you’re automatically going to be better than someone with aim assist on console.
However, I just don’t see the logic in that. It takes YEARS for someone to actually become very good at aiming on a mouse, and that’s a fact. Nobody can simply get on a mouse and keyboard and slay out an entire lobby. That’s extremely unrealistic. Coming from someone who RARELY plays shooter games, I recently had someone tell me that I should be playing way better since I’m on MnK, but I think that’s just silly. What do you guys think? Are all mouse and keyboard players automatically amazing at aiming off the bat because they have a mouse? Should all mouse and keyboard players 100% be expected to preform better than someone who has aim assist?

Edit: After being complete garbage at using MnK, I’m going to play a ton with controller (which I haven’t played with in at least 4-5 years) and see some results for myself.",4,/r/gaming/comments/g3hwk9/mouse_and_keyboard_on_console_my_take/

g41tuy,gaming,playstation is outdated,"I originally wrote this for unpopularopinions however I need 70 karma

ps2 was my first PlayStation and it was the best since online playing wasn't an option for me I could play with my friends on the ps2 which made sense at the time.
ps3 came which was a fantastic console with no payments for online gaming and it supported blue ray and had RCA connector which was everything I needed.

then the ps4 came out I bought it a soon as possible however the issue was that there were no laws written for the console so everyone in my country had to wait few months for it while other countries got it in December we got it in late February. my friends flew oversea to buy it only to be taxed at the airport huge sums
At the time pc computers were getting pretty fast and to my disappointment, the ps4 wasn't really that fast however the quality was amazing.
I didn't buy the PlayStation plus for the first year until I bought a game that only included online play so to play it you had to buy PlayStation plus.
PlayStation Plus gives you extra storage multiplayer and free monthly games that are picked by PlayStation. these games are almost never fun to play or exciting and when there is it's probably not for your region. You can check the comments on their website were they announced the monthly PlayStation games. where people tell whether they are happy with the decision
once the PlayStation subscription is over you are locked from playing your downloaded PlayStation plus games until you buy PlayStation plus subscription again. 
storage is 500 GB for the original so people started to replace them by themself with 1000gb when the PlayStation 4 came out.
however, 1000gb is not really that much if you are planning on playing more than 5 big games.
if it says it's 16gb on the disc case god knows what it really is. all of the time it's much more and when there is free space on the console it always needs more. when you have deleted something you go to the information try to find the error and download it.
with PlayStation plus you get an additional 100GB cloud storage that goes away 6 months after your expired subscription.

I made the decision to buy a pc for 700 dollars. my god, it was fantastic compared to this garbage of a console. You could do exactly everything the same except much much better.
easy to browse the internet. no limited games. no loud fan. software. watch movies so much quicker. applications. and much more.
 and the mouse for the pc. not that stupid controller which is impossible to aim with
the controller was similar to a fully grown adult trying to please a catholic priest, it just didn't work for me. I finally found the kid.
and my god the touchpad ""the future of gaming"" has never been used

also, the stats on ps5 compared to Xbox is embarrassing

if they stopped charging for online and allowed cross playing multiplayer with pc for the ps5 I would maybe buy it
their support team is garbage and they know it
impossible to get a refund

it's not only the PlayStation sony is a garbage company in general

It's great. The series overall is good IMO when it comes to the plot and the definitive ending is on the same level. I mean there were no plotholes created in the story at all (even Nadine got herself an ending), no loose ends whatsoever, every character was either properly killed or they live their lives now, it gets explained exactly what happened to Nate, Elena, Sam and Sully and they even show their damn kid.

Don’t get me wrong, I love the Xbox controller; I think it’s the most comfortable controller out there ATM and the DualShock 4 actually made Sony’s controllers comfortable too, but both fix your body in a certain position. 

I’d love to see split controllers on the other consoles. They just allow you to relax more and get into a more comfortable position. I think the joycons are the worst out of the current systems for the ergonomics and button placements but they do let you just relax.

g4xrum,gaming,My Opinion - What is the mobile game of 2021 that's going to beat Pubgm,"Each year , Tens of new mobile games becomes popular in different types of the community . But only 2 games on the history were able to gain the love of all that types at same time .. And I think you know them right Clash of clans ( 2017 - 2018 ) Pubg Mobile ( 2019 - 2020 ) .

Tho at the middles of 2018 , Most of people started getting bored from Clash of clans because of the pay2win gameplay , Which is like how people started getting bored from pubg because of the badly-designed ratting system where you need to be a camper or a super extremly profisinal player to progress .

And here it comes the question , What is going to be the game of 2021 ? Lots of people thought about call of duty mobile , Free Fire , cyber hunter etc .... But by my self I think people wants a new type of games , So they wouldn't actully search for another battle royal or another FPS .

**So i'm going to say ""League Of Legends Mobile"" has the highest chance to become the mobile game of 2021 for the following reasons :**

Full AAA games that have made it to mobile:

1. Grid Autosport
2. GTA 3
3. GTA Vice City
4. GTA San Andreas
5. GTA Chinatown Wars
6. GTA Liberty City Stories
7. Doom
8. Doom 2
9. Doom 3
10. Duke Nukem
11. Star Wars KOTOR
12. Fortnite
13. Harvest Moon: Light Of Hope
14. Harvest Moon: Seeds Of Memories
15. PUBG

&amp;#x200B;

Mobile games based on console or PC games or franchises that have been cut down a bit:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Call Of Duty Mobile
2. Mario Kart Tour
3. Minecraft Pocket Edition
4. SimCity BuildIt
5. Need For Speed: No Limits

If all these games can be ported to mobile, or special versions of them can be made for mobile, I don't see why other AAA games can't come out on mobile in one form or another.

g5x951,gaming,Ocarina of Time is a very good game," What would you say to the people who aren't that sure about the old graphics to encourage them to play older games?   


I had a strange realization couple of days ago.   
We had a Zelda evening and we were playing OoT (N64, not remastered). Although I was eager to finish the fire temple so I could play BotW afterwards I got really into the old game! The game world was blocky, lacked some detail and there weren't that many NPCs yet still the game world felt alive and interesting.   
All in all The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time is a groundbreaking masterpiece which, despite the limitations of it's time, very much deserves its title as one of the best games ever made. If you haven't played it in a while (or ever!) I really recommend you pick it up!  
As a bonus: The usage of the same assets (child and adult time) saves precious space on the old cartridges impresses me as game designer!

g6bfvg,gaming,Would I enjoy Sniper Elite 3 and 4?," 

I've played both Sniper Elite 1 and V2: I heavily dislike V2 unlike the original for a bunch of reasons:

* Enemy Snipers being aim-bots that hit you instantly who never move.
* Easy to exploit enemy AI due to them not being able to climb.
* Extremely linear levels.
* The awkward camera that you can't swap to the other shoulder.
* Everyone on the map knowing exactly where you are because of a single gunshot.
* Lack of friendly AI

&amp;#x200B;

And just in general the somewhat poor level design, such as enemy snipers blatantly spawning in once you walk past certain bits of the map so they get to shoot you even though you already checked the room they spawn in.

All of these elements ment that while I enjoyed the OG Sniper Elite, I seriously disliked 2 after the first few inital levels.

g6jtv5,gaming,The potential of VR as shown thanks to HL:Alyx (and my own wishful thinking),"I guess this is sort of a shower thought post as well, I just have a lot of thoughts on this, and I NEED to just put them out into the world. Most companies have treated VR as something experimental so far, and that's not a knock against games like Pavlov, Beat Saber, Robo recall, etc. But so far, most of it has been in the ""proof on concept"" stage as far as I can see.

HL:Alyx changed that, it's not just a proof of concept, it's an actual game. It made me think of what we might see from the gaming industry in the future in regards to VR. Personally, I see three genre's that will benefit immensely from VR... in no particular order of preference:

1. Survival games. This struck me as I saw someone do a ""mythbusters"" video about HL:Alyx, one of them was ""Get a crate, any extra grenades or injections you find, put in the crate and carry them with you"" Which... actually worked, but the game did eventually crash. This made me think of an idea, a VR survival game with no ""inventory"". Sure you can find a backpack or a chest. But the items stored in the backpack or chest is STORED in there, physically. No menu no nothing like that. If you want someone from your backpack, you take it off, open it up and grab what you need. If you want to store items at your base, you have to actually have crate stacks, shelves, etc. For me, that would lead to an incredibly immersive experience. Think of a game like... The Long Dark, with this kind of inventory system.
2. RTS. We've seen a few of these, mostly proof of concept. I have a very specific niche of the RTS genre in mind though. The Homeworld series. Imagine that you ARE  [Karen S'jet](https://i.redd.it/uww7p2by2pj31.jpg). you ARE fleet command, you see the space around you... around you, you can physically reach out and touch your ships to connect to them, and then command them. (Ideally, with an improved form of voice command, but not necessarily) That utter immersive nature of seeing the world in a way Fleet command would.
3. Technically, also an off-shot of the RTS genre, but it's unique enough. God games. We've seen a few of these as well, like Deisim and Super Island God VR (Although they seem a bit like puzzle games in disguise), but they still seem a lot like Proof of concept games. I would LOVE to see a game akin to the Black&amp;White series, with proper looking graphics and what not. B&amp;W even had 'hand gestures' as a quick way to cast miracles, how cool would that be with your ACTUAL hands?

I hope for a lot of great things in the future from VR",4,/r/gaming/comments/g6jtv5/the_potential_of_vr_as_shown_thanks_to_hlalyx_and/

g6qkp3,gaming,Genuine Question: How come we havent gotten more games out of Capcom as of late?,"This is a genuine question I have that I really want to open a discussion on. Not me taking jabs at Capcom, but rather trying to hopefully garner support and possible outreach to Capcom. But to the point, Im curious as to why Capcom hasnt been just pumping out titles as of late. Capcom has over 3 decades worth of experience under their belt, almost 3000 employees at their disposal, and a wealth of IPs at their fingertips. So far, as of late, Capcom has only released remakes in the past couple years, expansions to existing games, and collections. While not bad in their own right, it still begs the question as to why they havent done anything new. Not even necessarily a new IP, but theres a lot they havent been doing lately. They have games like Deep Down that was originally supposed to be launch title for the Ps4 when announced a year or 2 prior to the actual release of gen 8. There are numerous rumored titles in the works, and titles that have been highly demanded for years by the fanbase that Capcom themselves have acknowledged, but done very little about. From Dino Crisis, to even themselves bringing up a Mega Man Battle Network style game relaunch, they have so many forgotten titles to choose to bring back, but havent. I know this will never likely reach Capcom, probably get downvoted to oblivion, and/or come off as a inconsequential rant, but with nearly 3000 employees and most of their titles being self made, I geniune hope Capcom starts pumping out something soonish. Especially with the recent drought in game releases and news. They did say earlier in the year that they planned to have 4-5 big game releases between April 2020-March 2021, one of which being the RE3 remake which is now out in the wild. So who knows what the others could be. Monster Hunter World is still getting supported, and SF5 just wrapped up.

I'd obviously rather have a pc, but sadly I travel a lot and I wouldn't have access to my pc for at least 5 months a year. I have a pretty tight budget so I can't afford a laptop with 1660ti as they are very expensive in my country.

P.S. I've been a console gamer my entire life only playing PC games on occasion.

It's like perfectionism except i want it to be perfect RP-wise and all according to some predefined idea of what the play should feel like.

Then the next morning i wake up and tell myself this time i'll game without obsessing and i fail and the whole pattern repeats.

The obsession is a cause for more obsession even for when i think about all the erased saves i feel it's a big mess and certainly not the way i wanted to play and now there is no going back to the clean slate.

My mom got me the PS4 as a birthday gift and now she's sad looking at me not managing to have fun. And i feel ashamed and stupid for obsessing over video games like that while it's just supposed to be a nice hobby and i should keep doing more constructive things as well

Me and my friends wanted to try different kinds of games, from all genres ( even the ones we dont like ) and got inspired from ""20 videogames every gamer must play before they die"" and the stereotyped kind of person who uses those kinds of arguments on the internet:
""If you havent played game X and Y you ain't an gamer""
""You need over 200 hours on game Z to talk to me""

And we thought it would be awesome to non-ironically do it! So, we are trying to make an big playlist for us to play from all kinds of genres, what could you guys recommend us?

We will try not to Metagaming that much, i promise.

I thought about something like 

Left 4 Dead 2
COD MW2
Borderlands
Halo

Then going to something like

Terraria
Stardew Valley
Minecraft

Trying something competitive, like

CSGO
LOL
Rocket League

And even maybe Skyrim with the multiplayer mod, so spreading it like that, all kinds of tastes, from all kinds of people.

So, what you guys recommend? It could be any game, any genre, and it would be even better if it was multiplayer

g7uf11,gaming,Gaming Rut,"I wanted to share my current situation right now to basically just get it out of my system. I'm a gamer of 30+ years. I can still remember sneaking out of bed to play Mario Bros on the gigantic console TV. I've always loved playing games for many different reasons. Sense of accomplishment, get away from reality, fun with friends, etc.

In 2006 or so I was introduced to what a MMORPG is, specifically Final Fantasy Online thru a coworker. With FF being my favorite series I was hooked. I had a laptop for school that I used to play it. Looking back at the specs I'm surprised it even ran! In 2009 I bought myself a desktop PC and was told by the friendly Circuit City employee that sure this will play games! A HP Pavilion A6700F. Woof. During this time I had my Xbox 360 and PS2 and did sometimes play other games. FFXI was always my go to. 

By 2012 I was in a way tired of playing a game that demanded so much attention where I felt like I barely achieved anything. It was fun though. By this time I had purchased a PS3 and The Last of Us held my attention for months. Bought some other titles too like Sleeping Dogs, Bioshock, and a few others. My now wife was heading to school and she wanted/needed a PC for her study room. I had been looking into building my first PC so I did my research, cleaned up the old HP so she could use that, and I made my first gaming PC. In late 2013 it was completed and I had my first gaming PC. 

I was first dumbfounded how much cheaper games were, especially how highly rated and recommended games were sold in bundles. I looked at games I had missed out on while being in FFXI land and started basically collecting games. Bioshock Infinite and Skyrim absolutely blew my mind with how great they looked, how great they ran, and I had freedom to mod. Shoot, some games I spent more time modding than playing. I also had my PS4 which I'd sometimes get games for. TLoU remastered, baseball (huge baseball fan and always loved playing), and other titles. I've always been a patient gamer and I was amassing a mountain of titles that I had never played because they were so cheap. 

The main thing I was having fun with was fiddling with the PC itself. By now I think I've used eight different cases. I've changed cpu/mb a number of times, constantly changed video cards, and kept adding drives for storage. I also built some PCs to sell for fun and to make a few bucks. I enjoy learning about new hardware and checking out YT people that build and test. 

In 2016 I gave into Dark Souls. Finally (sort of) got gud. Loved the series. Dark Souls 3 by far has the most hours of any game. Love Bloodborne equally. Still haven't beat the last boss of the DLC. After Dark Souls I wasn't having fun with other RPG like games. At the time I had my fill of other games like shooters and what not. I was bored. 

I had heard my old friend FFXI had massively changed. I gave in and made a new character. It was like a different game almost. After months of getting thru old content and most of the new story I was ready for joining a group to tackle events that required, well, groups. I started falling out of love again after a few events. Waiting on people. People acting nuts. Spending hours doing something where I didn't ""get"" anything. I suspended my account. 

By this time my PC was basically finished. The only thing left for me to do would be getting a video card that I couldn't justify spending the money on. Or I could look into sound upgrades but really I don't need it. I'm happy with my setup. Oh, monitors. I'm currently using a 32"" 2560x1440 144HZ VA panel. Prior I had a 4K panel. Without a doubt I believe my current panel is much much better than 4K. I wasn't really actively looking for anything to buy, rather to sell some other things I had laying around. I frequent /r/hardwareswap and last year I got the mother of all deals, at least for me. I bought my final upgrade, a RTX 2080. I was complete. 

So great right? You have all the games, a great PC, and plenty of time right now so you should have fun gaming right?? I'm not. I made a career change last October and am actually waiting to start. I would've started this last February but Covid hit and here we all are. I'm bored. Nothing holds my attention. When I look at my options of things to play my mind goes to Dark Souls or FFXI. Shoot, yesterday I got Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and while I enjoyed the 90 minutes or so I played it, I was almost tired. Like, I don't think I'm up for this type of a challenge. 

My wife has noticed and she says just go play what you like, meaning if I really want to play FFXI just go play it. I have a strong feeling of guilt even thinking about that game because 1)I have so many other games to play 2)I don't need to waste money on the sub fee 3)I finally have the PC to do all the things and I'd be using it to play a 15 year old game. 

I didn't intend for this post to become as long as it has, but here we are. I have thoughts on why games that bore me do, even when thousands enjoy the same game and these games are praised as some of the greatest ever made. What I can explain in quick fashion is my reasoning for enjoying FFXI in a respect is it's task oriented nature. Do thing for X-time or X amount of times and get reward, eventually. And it's the hit of dopamine that makes me think of returning.",4,/r/gaming/comments/g7uf11/gaming_rut/

I used to really want to play Minecraft hunger games but there weren’t any servers of battle mini games at the time, so I downloaded some game off the Xbox store.  It was a hunger games style game that had you competing in rounds against other opponents, collecting chests and loot.  The visuals, concept, and presentation were obviously heavily based off of Minecraft’s, except that there was much less lighting and the colors seemed dull and darker.  The gameplay also felt a little slower and floatier.  I think it would be reasonable to assume it was a low budget game.    The battles took place in a big open world with some structures.  I’m not sure if the opponents were real players on Xbox live or just bots, but I have a feeling it was an online game, I’m just not sure if I even had Xbox Live at the time that I played it. I don’t know if it’s still on the Xbox store, and I don’t think I have it on my Xbox anybody, though all I really want is the game’s name.

Basically I am looking for games that two players can play locally on the same PC with split or shared screen, with a third player who can play online with their own PC, and join the game.

With the current state of the world I'm missing my brothers a great deal and we are looking for a way to play some games together. They live together but only one of them has a gaming PC to use. I have my own gaming PC at my house but can't visit so we can hang out and we thought this was a good solution. They have two controllers and headsets for their shared PC all ready to go.

Like I said, I have tried Google for answers but it seems to give results talking about local or online multiplayer, but not in the context of them being available together in the same session.

g8pmjv,gaming,The Dark Truth About Animal Crossing,"**The Dark Truth About Animal Crossing**

&amp;#x200B;

* A novel coronavirus wiped out 99.9% of mankind
* Some raccoons broke into a lab and ingested a drug that is designed to repair brain cells 
* The raccoons learned how to think and communicate human-like 
* The raccoons gave these drugs to other mammals like bears, deers and cats and they too became intelligent 
* The drugs were running out so the animals decided to experiment with eating human brains
* They captured a few humans and feasted on their brains and they realized they got smarter and walked more upright after eating a human brain. They realized they were able to think more creatively by eating just the right brain.
* Over a few centuries of experimentation with humans, they decided to create a plan that will sustain their new found intelligence
* The original name of the plan is called Plan Animal Crossbreed. The goal is to breed smarter animals by breeding the original drug enhanced animals and their descendants with those that only ingested human brains. 
* However things weren’t progressing as fast as they had hoped and they realized that human brains are not the tastiest when the humans were in constant fear
* So the plan was later on named Animal Crossing, a mega plan to farm high quality human brains 
* Nook Corp was set up to invite the humans who came to age to own an island
* On this island, the human can build and create anything he or she likes and some upright speaking animals will also live on this island with them 
* They will grow fruits together, build villages, terraform the island and decorate the place with old relics of the past from various cultures
* There is even a museum that preserved some of human’s knowledge about dinosaurs, insects, fish and also some of the most famous artwork from the past 
* There is a section of the museum that explained the ancestors of the upright walking animals but it never went into details on how that came to be
* Sometimes Nook Corp will send presents via balloons to accelerate the decoration process
* When the human has completed designing an island that is worth 5 stars, the Nook Corp committee will deem that human as ready to harvest
* Achieving a 5 star island requires a ton of creativity and the right brain of the human would have fully developed to evolve the animals further 
* The human will then be transported by Dodo airline to Nook Corp’s headquarter, get slaughtered and their brain will be served as a delicacy to the royal descents of the First Raccoons
* The animal crossing human brain farming system over a network of islands around the world is the most successful plan to date
* Climate change was reversed, the ozone layer hole was repaired, rainforests started to grow, and mother nature reclaimed the planet
* Animals and humans now lived happily ever after",4,/r/gaming/comments/g8pmjv/the_dark_truth_about_animal_crossing/

Much like some people are great at Chess without much practice, some people are really bad at Chess no matter how long they play, same goes for VIDEO games, if you’re not a very decision making oriented individual, you’ll have a very tough time being a top player in MOBAs or RTSs, and no matter how much effort you put into those types of games, you might never be more than mediocre, while a player with 50 hours of game time, but a good mind for those games will absolutely shit on you with 10x less experience.
If you’ve been playing say, League of Legends for 10 years, and you’re still a Silver player, you can still have fun, but that’s the universe telling you, MOBAs are not for you.

Far cry: when i download the game and launch it, there is that usual tab telling you that it is installing directx etc. etc. but in my case it shows up for like 0.5 sec and then disappears. When i check task manager it says the F3steamupdater.exe is running. I can't even stop the process from steam i just must manually kill it in task manager. If i run the FC3 exe file as an administrator uplay will require an activation key from me, which is wierd because i already activated the game on my old lap top. I searched for where to find the key and it is supposed to show up in small menu when you right click the game in the steam library saying view CD keys, but i don't have such thing at FC3. Funnily enough other games are showing it.

Crysis: i run the game and i just get black square probably in resolution 800x600 the game is not responding and i need to kil it through task manager. If i run it as an administrator i get fullscreen black screen and the game still not responding.

But their stories are usually well thought out, and you can sink hundreds of hours into a game. I also like how they thrive on mods, which allow users to get creative and add more fun.

With God of War I'm not worried of getting bored and putting it down since it's linear and doesn't seem very repetitive. But since it's linear and I'm home all day doing nothing I think I'm gonna finish it in like 2 days.

g4acra,gaming,Gaming has become a bit stale. We need new IPs,"Gaming has definitely become a bit stale. What do I mean by that. What were the big releases this year so far?? Doom eternal(sequel), Animal crossing(sequel kinda), Resident Evil 3 (remake), Final fantasy VII (remake), Half Life Alyx(sequel), Nioh 2 (sequel). To be fair cyberpunk 2077 will release later this year which is a new IP and I for one can't wait becouse 95% of yearly releases are either sequels or remakes. Where are the new IPs?? One studio that I absolutely love is fromsoftware studios just because this generation alone they have given Dark souls 3 (sequel) and after that they have given 2 unique and fresh IPs and they are working on a new IP as well. Now on quarantine the two biggest releasees were remakes (resident evil 3 and final fantasy 7) these games I have played them years ago. Now I am not saying that don't put out remakes and sequels but capcom has literally turn into a remake company. Just release Resident Evil 8 or (crazy idea) give us a new IP. Ubisoft every single year will release a sequel to one of their already existing franchises. Everyone hates bethesda for what they did with fallout 76 and rightfully so but at least they have the guts to give us a new IP even though Elder Scrolls 6 will literally break the internet. It will make bank. Now I want to play Elder Scrolls 6 before I die but I am happy that they give us something new and I am eager to see what this is. I just want to play something fresh. Companies just go to the safe route of releasing a sequel because let's be fair just giving us a sequel is money guarantee. Making a new IP is a big risk for a company which might lead to money loss but I just want them to break the monotony and play something that I have no idea what I am gonna play.

g09ekl,gaming,Video Games Should Not Cost $60,"Since the 1990's video games have traditionally costed $50-$60 dollars. Every new release costs $60, they do get cheaper over time as the demand naturally goes down (except for Nintendo), but for the first 6 months to year, the price remains at $60 dollars. This puts the Video Game Industry in a pickle. This is because gamers don't want to buy games for more than $60 and video games are more expensive to produce as technology has become more advanced and expectations have risen. 

Video Game companies must then rely on shady tactics such as micro-transactions, loot-boxes, abusing gaming psychology to increase play-time and chances of micro-transaction purchases, paywall, making half-baked games, and pretty mich everything EA, Bethesda, Activision-Blizzard and all the other game companies are known for. The issue is, can you blame them? A Triple-A title can cost between 15 Million to 150 Million. That is a lot of money to spend on development and marketing. Also, these companies cannot increase the $60 price because gamers believe all games should cost $60.

The issue is, if you input $60 through an inflation calculator, you'll see $60 from 1990 is somewhere equal to $118 - $121 now. Video games should cost double what they do now. As a result, these companies have to use sneaky tactics that we hate. After doing the math, I can't blame them too much. They gotta make money, and video game players don't want to change the base price.

Now, this $60 thing will not last forever. Look at Coca-Cola, for decades they had the whole ""Every Coke is 5 cents"" campaign. The issue is, inflation caught up with them and coke became more expensive to make than they made back, so they had to bring the price back up. Video games will end up doing the same thing.",35,/r/gaming/comments/g09ekl/video_games_should_not_cost_60/

g3etxg,gaming,Is anyone else feeling less and less enthusiastic about games as the years go by?,"I’m not sure if this is just me finally losing interest in something I’ve been passionate about for the last 15 years, or whether the industry has actually just changed so much that what I would call the ‘golden age of gaming’ is finally ending but games coming out these days just don’t hold a candle to the games I played when I was a kid. Repetitive multiplayer experiences dominate the industry, which I understand is because they make more money and are easier to produce. But it used to feel like there was room for those games alongside the ones that felt like real ART. Granted, once in a blue moon you’ll still get great story driven single player experiences that comes out. I’m in no way saying those games are gone, just that there seems to be a lot more crap in between. Browsing through the lists of top rated games for sale, the vast majority it seems came out before 2016! I mean it’s been years and there’s maybe 3-4 AAA game studios that have made anything that feels like it has any kind of substance behind it. These days it feels like every dev just develops half a game and releases it early access as battle royale trash.

g89ecj,gaming,"Help me find a game ""Like"" Fortnite STW","Hi all. I really like Fortnite Save The World. The art style, the pacing, and the progression are lots of fun. However I've ""beaten"" the game, and need something new.

Games like Destiny, The Division and Warframe have a hectic pace and require rapid precise aiming, which is something I can't do. I also can't handle a ""realistic"" art style, because I'm very colorblind and thus don't see enemies until they've shot me. The slow-moving zombies of STW is just right for me, particularly since most maps involve either eliminating them in a small area or defending a point.

Any suggestions? It doesn't even have to be a first person shooter. I just want

You cannot disable it without taking apart the controller which I imagine most consumers won't do. Why do they need this microphone? It literally says in their post right after ""if you want to have a longer conversation you can plug in your own headset"". So what's the point of it, Sony just said that you should use your own mic anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said it's clear the microphone isn't there to communicate and talk with your friends. So why is it there? To listen in and gather marketing data for Sony? To open up the opportunity for the PS5 to be sold on the Chinese market (the biggest in the world) as the communist party can spy on more of their citizens. 

&amp;#x200B;

Their intenions with this microphone are unclear but I imagine more will be revealed when the privacy policy you have to agree to gets released.

g7v4vy,gaming,A Rant about Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"Disclaimer, all opinions are my own, from my perspective and my ideals. I do not condone forcing opinions on others and I will not ask you believe what I believe. I ask you try to understand my opinion and accept it as just one person putting his thoughts on the internet. If you don't find my thoughts valuable, good, they don't need to be.

I Don't like this game, however I please ask you read the whole post before commenting, specifically the final full paragraph. Please and thank you.

Call me Biased, call me stingy. But FF7R isn't FF7. It's two things, a ""modern game"" which refers to its feeling of just being what people want that has already been done by other games as well as being a nostalgia property therefore rather than being a game of passion and ideas, it's a safe bet to make lots of money. 

Secondly and this ties into the wanting money bit, the cross promotion with Butterfinger requiring you to buy a completely separate product in order to access content in a game you already most likely spent $60 or more on is insulting to a consumer. Yes it's very unimportant content that you won't miss and it's mostly just throwaway stuff, but it's the fact of the matter, content locked behind external products that could later down the line lead to games thinking it's ok to lock massive things behind external products like entire extra chucks of story. No I do not want to see how my game ends by buying the limited time FF18 Mcnuggets. I'm going a little off topic.

I'm definitely very stingy about certain things and this remake isn't for me anyway. I would have done anything for a classic turned based FF7R with the same gameplay, layout and environments with the only things changed are giving it a modern redesign of the graphics without changing anything in the environment nor its aesthetics and I guess voice acting, even though I'm not a fan of the current voice acting. I love turned based combat in games, I hate the new FF combat system. It's better in FF7R than it was in FF15, but I still find it very boring. I also find that due to having a rotating camera it kinda robs the magic of what the originals fixed camera did, make you see exactly what you both wanted and needed to see while hiding secrets in cool creative ways. 

It's just another modern game. It's a good just another modern game, just not what I would have wanted and what I got isn't something I want. Not every game has to be innovative, not every game has to be what I want. But I also don't need to like every game either. I'm sure you can thoroughly enjoy FF7R, I could see it being your new favorite game. FF15 I still don't understand how it could be anyone's favorite, that was hot garbage from the ground up, mostly due to a hellish development process. But FF7 was an incredible game. FF7R by it's nature has a great groundwork to start a build from. I don't like what they built but, If I understand correctly, the story, general aesthetic and character writing is the same, then in those regards we still have an incredible game and the only thing keeping me from enjoying it is the fundamental design of gameplay. It can be what it wants, I can not like it, and that's ok for both sides.

g2xs8e,gaming,!! Help !! Confined with no gaming rig. Only a Macbook Air 2010. What can I play?," 

Firstly please let's not make this about Mac VS anything else. I’m stuck and confined in Indonesia and can’t lay hand on any decent gaming rig.

—

Hi everyone, I am looking for an RPG or strategy game to play in confinement.

I only have an old Macbook Air with the following specs very low specs:

MacBook Air (11-inch, Late 2010)

OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 

Processor: 1.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo

Memory: 2 GB 1067 MHz DDR3

Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MB

So I can only run (old) games with very low requirements.

It’s so old it cannot support anything more recent than OS X 10.11. El Capitan and Steam doesn’t support El Capitan anymore. And the 1.4 GHz processor means that even games from the 2010 won’t run on it…

Also, I’m not tech savvy so I can only fiddle with my laptop with guides that have very clear instructions. I can't seem to be able to easy install Windows in a Bootcamp as I don’t have a Windows CD/DVD. I don’t understand how to do it differently, via iso file or whatnot.   
If you have a link to a good and simple guide, I'm happy to give it a shot tho.

If any of you has any good games that could run on low specs (directly on mac or via a simple app), please let me know! 

Thanks you so much in advance from a fellow gamer stuck with no gaming rig!",32,/r/gaming/comments/g2xs8e/help_confined_with_no_gaming_rig_only_a_macbook/

g54xte,gaming,Anti-Cheat: How Far Is Too Far?,"This post was removed from /r/Valorant like many posts before it about issues with the ring 0 kernel mode driver they are installing for anti-cheat. Original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/g54n5w/how\_many\_others\_have\_security\_concerns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/g54n5w/how_many_others_have_security_concerns/)   


I feel this is a valid concern that we as gamers should visit. I for one have no issues with anti-cheat/hack protections if they work, but this is too far, too much risk to benefit ratio.  I would like to hear from both casual gamers, like myself, and competitive gamers, hopefully esports pros. I have pasted my original post below and hopefully it can stay here so I can get opinions and POLITE discussion, and get the word out.  I am frankly surprised that more people aren't concerned about this.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
I am sure this post will get buried or removed like others with concerns about security or bugs in the anti-cheat, but here goes.  I cannot sit idly by and watch while this continues unabated. 

TL;DR Low Level anti-cheat driver with complete and absolute system access may have already been compromised and is very buggy. Are you concerned?

How many others like me have concerns about the fact that there are already videos showing people cheating, when the anti-cheat is literally a ring 0 level kernel mode driver?  


First off, Installing anti-cheat with low level access to your system is like buying the world's most powerful and advanced security system, installing it, then leaving the back door open all the time. It is never a good idea to let a 3rd party install software with complete and total access to your system. Now we are seeing increasing amounts of videos being posted to Youtube and this subreddit of people cheating in the game. This means at the very least that this protection has been bypassed. It means at worst, that this protection has been compromised.  


I made the mistake of falling for the hype and got my key.  I installed it, allowed the anti-cheat ""Riot Vanguard"" to install.  Upon reboot, I instantly starting having issues with my audio driver, stuttering audio, freezing up my system. I couldn't play other games, couldn't watch videos. I removed the game, found out that the ""anti-cheat"" remains on your system, running 100% of the time with low level access to the system, even though the game it was protecting is gone. I had to remove it separately. I rebooted, had to delete the files manually in safe mode, remove the registry entries.  Long story short, I ended up re-installing every driver on my system including my chipset drivers.  Everything was operating perfectly immediately prior to installing Vanguard anti-cheat.  No other changes were made to the system. 

 It isn't a matter of \*can\* it be exploited or hacked, it's a matter of \*when\*.  Yes, it takes more work, but with all this hype generating all these naive installs, is a juicy target worthy of the time spent. A buffer overflow exploit and boom, a malicious actor can install any code onto your system, using it for anything they want or taking anything they want.

Riot has responded to concerns with ""We can respond in a few hours"".  Enough time to compromise thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or more systems. They have offered large sums of money in bounties to those who crack the protections.  Do you think this matters when so much more is readily made by ransomware or identity theft?

While others are expressing concerns about Chinese plots and rootkits and so forth, I am going to lean toward this being a poorly thought out attempt to curb hacking in a video game. 

It's a video game. When it comes down to it, the gameplay isn't even that new or unique. Is it worth the security of your system? Are you willing to give up that much?",32,/r/gaming/comments/g54xte/anticheat_how_far_is_too_far/

fva0bf,gaming,Video games for 65 and up with no gaming experience,"Hey guys,

Since the corona hit and my mom lost her job she has been in a very bad place. She has nothing to do to spend her time and is so extremely bored. As someone who loves games myself I was hoping I could recommend things for her, but have no clue where to start. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has no real gaming experience. I know she loves things like candy crush and in her past has played those games where you have to search around the screen for items. I know she really wants a game that will keep her mentally stimulated. She loves puzzles and has her masters in statistics so she is incredible intelligent. I would love to find her a more cultured game than her simple candy crush. I think if she found something else she would fall in love with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

It would mean so much to me if people could help come up with ideas to keep her active. She has been just laying around the house either sleeping or being extremely upset. Im working on getting her into therapy but in the mean time something to keep her mind active would be so helpful.

I bought Dragon Age a while ago, but played it for a bit then put it down. I'm not sure  why I didnt connect with it. Maybe it's because I wanted a Skyrim or Witcher style experience. From what I remember, it plays more like an MMO? I've since played a metric ton of FFXIV so MMO's are more my thing, but I still have a few questions and need some convincing. 

Firstly, how open world is it? I felt locked into certain areas when I first played, does it open up? I dont think I got into it that much, I just remember the first area being a wintry one. 

Secondly, is it a good story, (and a long one) I really want to sink my time into a solid, engaging and fairly long story. 

Any info would be appreciated, and please convince me to download (my internet is so bad, so that's why I'm worried, its gonna take me about a day to download,  and dont want to wait and then delete after 2 hours of play.

fwi2uh,gaming,Which Game Should I Buy?,"I have a budget of around $65, and my Steam wishlist has multiple games. I am deciding weather to get Hollow Knight, Half Life: Alyx (more on that one later), or save the money for when KSP 2 comes out later this year.

Hollow Knight: I already own multiple platformers, so idk if I should get it or just wait until it’s very cheap on a sale or something.

KSP 2: It probably won’t come out until later this year, so I’m not sure if I should just save the money for it.

Half Life: I have never played a Half Life game but have recently gotten into watching summaries of the stories from 1/2 and I also have played both portal games which are in the same universe. Since I am kind of a wuss when it comes to games (especially VR) I am not sure if I’ll get scared shitless by one or two scenes in the game. I am leaning more towards this choice since I have seen lots of gameplay and it has better reviews than the other 2. I also heard that the controls are great (I play on a Vive) movement-wise which was one of my biggest concerns, so it is good that that isn’t a problem.

fzx72r,gaming,I am genuinely the worst player in all the games I play,"I've been gaming for almost 15 years now, and I used to enjoy it no matter what happened (was an escape due to family issues blah blah blah). As I've gotten older, I've enjoyed them less and less because any game I play, I am always the bottom of the barrel when it comes to performance.

Picture this: when you have over 1500 hours in a game, you'd expect to be at least halfway decent, right? This is what happens with most people as y'know, practice makes perfect.

Now let me explain where I lie:  
I have thousands of hours in numerous titles such as Rainbow Six: Siege, CS:GO, Overwatch, DoTA2, so on so forth. But my friends and I have noticed one consistent staple with all these games: I NEVER IMPROVE. I'm always the copper player, the unreliable player on the team. I've tried literally everything I can imagine and I never improve.

""But you should play games to enjoy them!"" I can hear you say. Well, let me put how I feel into perspective. 

\- I usually only get one kill per day in Siege. So 1 kill per 30-40 matches  
\- In Overwatch I play support and nothing else because I'm only useful if I don't have to kill to help my team

What I'm saying is just that it's not fun to never overcome anything. I can never reach my goals no matter how big or small and it's at the point where even though my friends still play with me, just me being on the team alone tends to make us lose every match. I can tell they don't really enjoy playing games with me but do so anyways because they're good people and don't want me to be alone.",31,/r/gaming/comments/fzx72r/i_am_genuinely_the_worst_player_in_all_the_games/

&amp;#x200B;

When I die, I normally spectate and they get averagely 30-40 kills. It sucks for us players who are just having fun and would want to enjoy this game. I even bought a battle pass since season 2 because I really enjoyed the game, but hackers are sucking the joy of me playing this game.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope the devs are going to do something about this because sooner or later, me and a bunch of people are surely going to quit this game. This BR game is the best I've played so far (I played almost every BR game) and I hope the devs are not going to screw it up.

Any time a topic of criticism comes up regarding a game, someone criticises the game and explains they have played it a lot, for a few hundred hours for example.

There’s always a few idiots that say “well you’ve played it that much you clearly love or really like the game so you’re just hating it for no reason”. Like what? If you used your brain, you would realise the more you experience something the more 1) you start to discover the flaws with a product, 2) the more the novelties of the game wear off and 3) the less tolerable you become to said flaws and sources of frustration.

If you really wanted valuable critique from someone, it would be players who know the game from top to bottom. I for example have spent hundreds of hours playing GTA Online. Do I love it? Nope. I heavily dislike the game now. I played from the beginning and hate many of the directions Rockstar Games has taken with it. Are my criticisms suddenly invalid because I’ve played the game a lot? Nope. It’s ironic as these same people are also the type to say “well you can’t know if you really like it without playing it more”. You play a small amount = to them your criticisms are just mindless hate. You play a lot = to them your criticisms are just mindless hate.

fzyzld,gaming,Opinion: Open World games should have unbeatable enemies,"Like, permanently unbeatable. It gets tiring really fast when you become the prophecized dragon slayer, mage master and assassin king all at once and can take on all enemies at any time.

The first few levels, where the range of enemies shows, usually give you a wide array of gameplay styles. For overpowered enemies, it's not a battle, but a chase scene... and victory is successfully getting away from the enemy with your hard-earned loot and 30 minutes of unsaved playtime. As you get stronger you just stopped giving a damn and stroll around the world like nothing matters. It would be nice if there's always a beast from which you have to run.

&amp;#x200B;

The game that came closest to doing that for me, where it took very long for me to become OP was Final Fantasy XII. That and the lack of quicksaves made it really intense. Frustrating at times, yes, but intense all the same and extremely rewarding.",30,/r/gaming/comments/fzyzld/opinion_open_world_games_should_have_unbeatable/

I'm cool with it being different; I like the mechanics and the story depth is great but I was so mad when I learned it ended at midgar. not only that but, without the content after, it's a terrible standalone for FF. there's no party selection/development, no exploration beside ""here are your 3-6 side quests,"" and no real items to collect. 

I guess I just wanna know - did yall just know exactly what you were getting? did it meet your expectations as a standalone? is there a petition or something to let SE know they dropped the ball?

g20652,gaming,I’m being left out by my gaming group. What can I do?,"I have a group of three friends (K, L, and B) that I hang out and play video games with. I’ve known K since childhood and L/B for the last three years through work originally. K is also my roommate.

We’ve developed a group that started out playing games together about once a week or so into a group that plays together roughly every night, time permitting. 

Our main game for the majority of the time was Overwatch. The game ended up becoming stale after a couple years for all the members in our friend group so we opted out of playing it and went on the hunt for a different game. We tried a few games and none clicked for the group.

L and B ended up finding Rainbow Six Siege at one point, which was an old favorite of theirs. K and myself didn’t care for it. We tried and tried to make it work but it didn’t click for our half of the group and honestly just made me upset and angry while playing.

One day our group decided to try out the game Apex Legends. This was the one. Everyone had a great time playing it. The only downside is that we could only play competitively in three person groups so one person would be left out of the squad or we would have to split into two groups of two and play casual matches. This usually wasn’t a big deal as we came up with a rotation plan that involved swapping out members as we did errands and played other games. This worked for a few months. In the meantime our group gave Siege another shot but again it just didn’t work out for me but K seemed a little more interested this time.

A little over a week ago B, L, and K tried Siege yet again. This time it seemed to click for them. I wanted to keep playing Apex but every time one of them would get on Siege to kill time while waiting for their turn on Apex, they would draw my other squad members in to play with them instead. At this point I should mention that when they play Siege “seriously” they mute everyone in the party that’s not in their game of Siege. This effectively means I’m alone in the party as they play Siege together. They don’t come back when this happens. I let them know that I will not play Siege and every once in a while I would criticize the game out of spite, saying things like it’s a “camping simulator” and being shot/shooting people through walls and ceilings as a core gameplay mechanic is lame.

One day soon after this started I had enough (while I was drunk) and ripped into Siege with all my thoughts and opinions of the game as they were migrating over to it. B got incredibly angry that I was trash talking his “favorite game” and said I was angry because I’m trash and can’t handle the game. He said I should stick to Apex because it’s easy to rank up as you “only go up in rank points”. Then B and L proceeded to mute me but K stayed behind and played Apex with me the rest of that night.

Ever since then, things have changed. B, L, and K now only play Siege. I am never asked to get on or join parties anymore. B changed all our group chat customization options to reflect their new obsession with Siege and all they talk about in the Messenger chat is Siege. They don’t say anything to me and I don’t say anything to them. They now stay up later than ever playing together long beyond where they used to call it quits before.

I’ve considered leaving the group chat. I’ve considered calling them out for ostracizing me for trash talking a game. I feel like I’ve lost my friends that I’ve gamed with for the last few years. K occasionally says things to me in passing while in our apartment but it doesn’t feel the same to me. I don’t know what to do. I know these friends are too prideful to apologize for ostracizing me like this so they will likely continue this until I apologize myself, though I don’t feel this is my fault.

Is it worth it rebuying just for the complete edition? Am I being dumb lol

ftduuo,gaming,Jurassic Park: Builder shut down a couple days ago : (,"I usually despise mobile games, but this one has a special place in my heart. I remember back when I'd play it every day, and it was a part of my morning, and nightly routine. But one day, the game glitched, and deleted my entire park I'd been working on for like 3 months. So I contacted the devs, and even though I never spent a dime on the game, they gave me an obscene amount of dino bucks. (The premium currency.) Cool people for doing that. I was able to purchase everything in the game, and skip all wait times. It was cool. I'd never been able to do that in a mobile ""waiting game"". However, it also took the fun out of the game. Since I could literally buy everything, and skip all wait times, there was no point in playing once I'd unlocked everything. Still an awesome experience, though.

Fair well Jurassic Park: Builder.

This is why I can't stand always online models. There's no reason we shouldn't get to keep our parks in some offline mode. Especially those who spent money on their park.",3,/r/gaming/comments/ftduuo/jurassic_park_builder_shut_down_a_couple_days_ago/

""Been thinking about checking with you since last night. 

Pay cuts are here too.

A bit more unfortunate for me, I might lose my day job anytime now. The timing of it all is unbelievably bad. But pretty sure will find new jobs and sort things out as soon as this is over. More important things at stake. \*\*\* and I are separated by 4 hrs and I cannot visit her as the entire country is on a lockdown until 14 april. 

So far even though a radical measure, has proven to be super effective in suppressing community spread greatly. 

Local small scale grocers are open but the entire country is consuming what's left behind as surplus. Unless the country gets back to its normal ops, food and other necessary commodities may see a shortage. But at the same time once the lockndown is lifted, and if asymptomatic carriers are running around,  its going to be a nightmare. 

Everyday waking up feels like its just a dream. 

And the worst part is no wifi. never had one.

Just watching cable tv and using mobile internet. And dont forget the small does of turmeric and black pepper in milk. That is an excellent immunity booster. I am taking it every single day.

ftj2jy,gaming,A new Test Drive Unlimited game is in development. (TDU 3?),"The studio behind the WRC and TT Isle of Man series is responsible.

It's been 14 years since the original Test Drive Unlimited set the template for open-world racers, and nearly ten since its lackluster post-Burnout Paradise sequel. So it's about time the series was revisited, and now we have confirmation that it will be: KT Racing - Kylotonn, the studio responsible for the World Rally Championship series, is currently developing an installment.

The news comes via Nacon's head of publishing Benoit Clerc. A bit of background: Nacon is the new name of Bigben Group, taking in its publishing, development and accessories concerns. Clerc made the announcement in an interview with VentureBeat.

Speaking about the studios Nacon has recently acquired, Clerc said the following about Kylotonn. ""They’re based in Paris and Lyon. They’re specialized in racing. They’re doing off-road racing with WRC, and they’re doing two-wheel racing with Isle of Man TT. They’re currently working on our biggest project by far, which is the next Test Drive Unlimited game.""

The studio's next game, TT Isle of Man 2, releases on March 20, so fingers crossed we'll hear some more substantial info on Test Drive Unlimited after that.

fuzbry,gaming,Gaming laptop,"Hey I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I said I'd give it a go just incase. 

having owned a Mac since starting college I've wanted to buy a laptop which I can game on but said I better not until I get my degree as I have a tendancy to get very addicted to things (Dota 2). Because of the current situation, I'm now cooped at home with my family with my degree coming to and end so feel now is the time to bite the bullet and buy one.

My budget is roughly €800 but If I can justify spending up to €1000 then so be it. I don't generally play the top games on the top settings but would like to be able to play the majority of games currently out and releasing (bannerlords is the main reason I want one now).

Personally I'd rather a somewhat lightweight laptop which I can bring around with me so I'd imagine a screen in the 15inch range would suit best. I've also been told an SSD is needed and HDD not so much.

If anyone has any suggestions I would be very grateful to hear them and am happy to supply more info if needed. Thanks in advance for anyone taking the time to reply!",3,/r/gaming/comments/fuzbry/gaming_laptop/

It can be a bit annoying though in that sometimes I feel like at the same time I am playing a game, even if I am really enjoying the game, I can find myself thinking about the ""next"" game. Like there is some kind of ""urgency"" there of ""checking off"" this game as another name on that huge list of games I want to play so I can start on the next.

At a logical level I understand it is completely unrational, I will never ever ""catch up"" to my backlog and it is a really stupid thing to want to catch up to. And I will never play all the games I want to play or find interesting. And the funny thing is that if I actually did catch up I think I would not like that as then I would have no games left I really wanted to play at that moment. It can be an annoying feeling though in some strange way.

fvi4ly,gaming,Metro Exodus Gold Edition The Two Colonels ➤ Прохождение ➤ Часть#12 ➤ Два Полковника ➤ Novosibirsk," Новая часть игры превзошла все ожидания и наконец-то перевела события в другое русло. Теперь придется путешествовать по бескрайним просторам русских земель, выискивать убежища, осуществлять вылазки, воевать с бандитами и мутантами, и главное, выживать, да еще и не в темных уголках метро, а на поверхности.   Выход отряда на поверхность развязал руки разработчикам – теперь графика может проявить себя на все сто процентов. Высокая детализация местности и всего окружения, красивые и довольно колоритные персонажи, огромное количество бескрайних локаций с частично открытым свободным миром – размах задумки поражает, игра получилась просто отпадной.  Но что самое главное, так это то, что игра сохранила все свои прежние черты в плане геймплея – как и раньше, место имеет и стелс, и дополнительные квесты, и вечная нехватка патронов, и крафт оружия, и модификация огнестрела и все то, что было в предыдущих частях.",3,/r/gaming/comments/fvi4ly/metro_exodus_gold_edition_the_two_colonels/

I hope everyone is surviving, anyways today I decided to play the first Crysis game as i've owned the game for a while but never decided to give it a go considering I played the console version and didn't like it (yes i am aware no one likes the console version) but I've only played through the first mission as I would like some help! 

First of all, the pop in ... the game still looks gorgeous however the pop in is really strange, as in, the is constant pop in all the time! and no settings in game can change this, apparently you can change this in some of the game files but im a pc spaz and have no idea how to do this

Also any tips for playing this game? the whole point of crysis 1 is complete freedom to how you play, something which i dont get, when i played this on xbox, it seemed like stealth was the only option to play, and i never know how to experiment in a game like this, so tell me any tips and tricks to making a more interesting gameplay experience!

Other than that i think im definitively going to enjoy this a lot more than when i played this on xbox, thank you for reading :)",3,/r/gaming/comments/fw1hld/first_time_playing_crysis_on_pc/

fwoxfr,gaming,Dualshock problem with PC,"Sorry if this was also somewhere else, but couldn't find any topic anywhere.

The problem isn't that my DS4 works flawlessly with pc in terms of lag, connection and smoothness. It connects well through USB Bluetooth dongle and InputMapper. BUT... I have to manually reconnect it in Windows Bluetooth settings by unpairing and once again pairing it. 
Every time I boot. 
If I hold down PS button it searches I guess for PS4 paired, and PC doesnt even know that it has to connect it once again... and it still says on controller (in windows bluetooth settings) that it is paired, but it isn't, the controller is just blind. So I delete it and once again pair, and voila it works. But that's a stupid workaround, so I'm asking you guys to somehow help me up with this. Can it be that my dongle is old?

fwr6ad,gaming,Why finishing a good game is so much harder then finishing a good book or TV series.,"I realised this just after finishing “A way out” which I strongly recommend. I have never completed a good game, without feeling so strange afterwards. A strange feeling that’s it’s over.

For me, a prime example of this is Read Dead Redemption 2, one of my favourite games of all time. 60 hours of main story campaign, with many more hours of side missions, you grow to love Arthur, the main character, and the gang members, and when it’s over, I always get a feeling that no other source of media can give me. 60+ hours of time invested into the final few moments.

When I get truly into a game, I always look forward to playing it. I think, ill do this and then play some of a certain game. And when it’s over you can’t do that anymore, you can’t go back to playing, you can’t re experience the story.

The way I tend to play games is like i read books or watch tv series, I find something I like and I watch/read/play until it’s over, but when I finish a book or series, I’m happy, I know the ending, it’s done, I can look for something else. With a game, I’m always very sad that it’s done, that part of my daily routine is gone.

I’m curious if it’s just me, or do other people feel this way. This has always happened to me, and only today, a few hours after ending a game, did I realise how strange it is. For anyone who has finished RDR2 and A way out especially, did you feel so strongly after finishing it? Or am I just strange.",3,/r/gaming/comments/fwr6ad/why_finishing_a_good_game_is_so_much_harder_then/

Then, in my twenties, I stopped playing video games almost altogether, while keeping browsing the internet. 

Now I'm 28 because of obvious reasons I gave video games another try. 

And I realized that nowadays my attention span and intellect can't handle anything more complex than crashing cars, jumping on shit and shooting guns. No real time strategy games anymore, no RPGs with character development, nothing that involves a stage of learning the rules and complex thinking. Just things like broforce, hotline Miami and burnout paradise. 

It seems like gaming used to be some sort of exercise for my brain that also trained me to be focused on task. Now, after years of internet surfing but (almost) no gaming, I feel like I'm dumber than my teenage self in a way. I don't feel like playing anything complicated, I easily get discouraged. 

Now I know that gaming is still not the most productive thing one can do during quarantine, I just realized it's less harmful than internet surfing and provides at least a little bit of exercise for my mind.

The first level of the game is basically just the player in the character's apartment which is a big fancy studio with a lot of cool interior design and tech. You can move the player around and if you click on different things in his house he speaks out a description of that thing (for eg: if you click on his computer he describes what the specs are and how he uses it to play Ducati 3).

I was on Instagram and found this amazing hoodie and I decided to buy it!

I have been very impressed by the quality of the hoodie and the actual print. The best part was just how cheap it is! It is shipped to everywhere in the world so anyone can get it. It took only 2 days for mine to come. it is very comfortable to wear and I have been wearing it for the last week now it is so good!

fyd9jx,gaming,Control - an essentially good game that lacks polish,"I am eager to put down my thoughts as I am so twisted about this game.

  


The game is outstandingly looking. I have played it on a Playstation 4 Pro and except for some few moments, it performed smoothly - which is incredible, given the graphical bombast on display. For example, when enemies drop small health markers, they can still be seen from kilometers away (as was noticeable in one later story stage I don't want to spoil). It is absolutely fascinating to see concrete and other objects being ripped out of near vicinity and smashing them against an enemy, possibly resulting in a fantastic red dust explosion.

  


The building and its architecture are equally impressive and outstanding with their many details, i.e. texts and pictures on walls and small objects everywhere. I found it quite surprising though how many of these rooms just didn't serve any purpose and were empty, as if the level designers ran out of work and just tried to put in as much as possible. This again indicates a lack of polish.

  


I adored the general art design: the more or less black-white-ish surroundings filled with red accents and lighting is incredibly looking and carries the entire game. The use of real-life cinematic compared to in-game scenes is also an incredible idea.

  


The gameplay is, unfortunately, more leaning towards the ""meh"" side, it feels very repetitive: one always has to enter a room and then clear out some enemies. This would be fine, if there wouldn't be so many of them, especially at later stages, where things really just feel like fighting off wave after wave - it becomes very ""gamey"". Another aspect where the lack of polish shows: upgrading weapons and abilities is very difficult due to sparse resources; so by the end of the game, the player will have only upgraded two weapons and maxed out not even a single ability, therefore missing out on exploring all the possibilities there might be in combat. (Why didn't they add cheat codes to the game? It would potentially increase the fun a lot.)

  


While many people have admired the story, I have to say ""meh"" again - it is just intentionally non-explicit. Especially in the beginning, the story seems to just drag on and bore. Many people have praised the script, but I have to strongly disagree: the dialogue often feels cringy, especially Jesse's inner monologue pieces within a dialogue.

  


This missing polish in terms of how players perceive the ""arc"" of the game also passes onto the gameplay: while after a few hours, the player receives some more abilities and more story pieces, which make the game a lot more fun, the first few hours spent in the game are quite boring. It seems like the game hasn't been playtested enough, because I know quite a few people who abandoned the game after a few hours because it wasn't apparent that story, as well as abilities, would become more interesting with the later stages.

  


I wish the game would have explored the idea of using real cinematic more: except for the many clips we can find on projects on screens with that one scientist, there aren't a lot of clips which are actually used \*in game\*.

  


All in all, since gameplay is the most important thing about a game, I can't help to say that Control can be a bit boring. That's a shame, because it has all the ingredients to be outstanding.",3,/r/gaming/comments/fyd9jx/control_an_essentially_good_game_that_lacks_polish/

Hey, I just wanted to share my opinion of New horizon so far. I’m wondering if I’m the on’y one feeling like new horizon is missing content. When you take a closer look to Pocket Camp and new leaf, you see a wide variety of services and upgrades possible. For example, the shop only having one upgrade compared to the 5 possible in new leaf. I get the fact that changing  your hair isn’t something really important, but in old animal crossing it felt like progression unlocking the air salon. 

Having some visitors like kicks from time to time is nice, but it still lacks the progression of opening a Kicks shop in your town. 

Getting bells stolen by a fox selling fake painting still felt like a progression because you could and needed to fill up your museum. 

I just have the feeling new horizon has the same gameplay has the original AC, but with better graphics ans terraforming to please the people.

It is a scene where a bunch of soldiers or special ops people with guns seem to be controlled as a squad. The setting is some kind of very dark forest and/or swamp. The monster they’re trying to kill looks like a tall athletic human without skin Seems his muscle is all exposed. Maybe the skin is red. 

Could not see the monster/creature’s face. It was either covered by a mask, or obstructed, it maybe it was something like many teeth.

In the short gif I think soldiers point a flashlight at him and he seems to be getting ready to either run or attack. His left  arm is extended. His right arm is firmly holding a pink pig or a piglet of large size. There is water under their feet so there are splashes. 

Overall scene is dark, soldiers exchange words with one another and trying to keep their lights on the creature.

g03lf5,gaming,I need help making a decision.,"Let's play a little game called Decide For Me!

Short explanation:
I can't decide on what game I want.

Before we begin:

I want to buy a game now, but I'm somewhat indecisive, and I wanted some input instead of just spinning a wheel on Google.
Any thoughts/opinions/advice would be good.

Elite Dangerous (which I played before on console).
Or Yakuza Kiwami 1.

So I only have around $20 to spend, right, or at least that's what I want to spend right now. 
Yakuza Kiwami is $19.99, and Elite: Dangerous is $14.99 on sale right now, for it's Deluxe Edition.

So here's some backstory to help you get up to speed:

I REALLY enjoyed Elite Dangerous when I played it on my Xbox One. But I play on PC now.
I was playing it on my Xbox One when the whole Thargoid thing first came around. Everyone freaked out about it. And I loved it a lot, but people are saying the game's ""gotten worse"" since I last played it around a year or two ago. It's just mining now, essentially.

As for Yakuza, I played Yakuza 0 (and still do) for months now since I got it back in late 2019.
I wanna continue the story and I love the minigames in Yakuza so far. I'm on PC so I only have access to Yakuza 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2. I want the first one for now, and maybe get the second one if I like Kiwami 1 later on, but I can't decide between that and Elite Dangerous.",3,/r/gaming/comments/g03lf5/i_need_help_making_a_decision/

Not necessarily an offline game, what I mean by that is yes you can play for hours and have fun but it has certain things like leveling skills, crafting, or building things that take X amount of time, so if you take a couple hour break to sleep or something you come back stronger or more progressed, in a sense. Similar to say Eve Online or Clash of Clans, where you can always have something working towards your progress whether your playing or not. If anyone knows of any games like this, please let me know!

g07qtw,gaming,"Turning off the ""Music"" in almost any game with good sound design makes the game feel more intense and immersive.","I was playing Uncharted 4: Lost Legacy, and I found the music a bit overbearing and distracting, so I decided to turn it off and wow the difference was drastic. It made quiet moments more intense, such as sneaking around enemies, or almost falling off a cliff. 

I know I might be an outlier in this regard, but I feel like overdone music in any media can be more of distraction than anything and pull me *out* of the experience. Think of Marvel movies, such as Infinity War for an example. But in terms of gaming, I feel way more connected to the world I'm participating in when there's not a blaring soundtrack of stereotypical ""intense music"" telling me how I should be feeling about a certain scenario, drawing me out of the world and calling attention to the fact that this is indeed media.

Another point, turning off the music often reveals how a scenario *truly* feels in a game. So if the game feels kind of lame without a soundtrack, it tells me that this part of the game doesn't have much depth t begin with, and the music was added to cover that up.

Idk, what are your thoughts on this? Have you played any games with the music turned off for a new sense of immersion?",3,/r/gaming/comments/g07qtw/turning_off_the_music_in_almost_any_game_with/

Cause then we have Abzu and for me personally there is where the game dips in quality. These bosses never feel like a challenge or any fun at all. Reno and Rude were consistent but a lot of the bosses were really uninteresting and just felt super gimmicky and annoying. Also some of the balancing on these enemies and bosses make no sense. The mermaid enemies that can turn you into a frog are insanely annoying and frankly a lot more challenging than some bosses and it feels more frustrating than anything. Even if you use their elemental weakness. I'm really dissapointed in Tokyo Team in their performance with these bosses it really seems like the Osaka team are becoming the shinning example of the great gameplay that Square Enix can provide espically with the Remind DLC ON KH3 I hope we can get some better boss design choices in the next game. Also if I would have to choose my favorite boss enemies/fights. It would have to be [SPOILERS] Sepiroth, Roche, and Behemoth.

They want to invite their classmates (10-11 years old) to play online games together at a designated time a couple of days a week. We were thinking about making a google doc or slide deck with links to various games because not all kids will have access to or desire to play a single game. I don’t know much (if anything) about this stuff, but I just want to help my kids feel less lonely and help them pass the time in quarantine.

Minecraft is an obvious choice, as my kids love it. Is there a specific server that allows kids from all different platforms (Xbox, phone, pc, etc) to play? Cross platform because some of the kids mights be on school-borrowed chrome books and I’m guessing they are not equipped for online gaming. Also, is there a way to play on PC in a web-based way without actually downloading anything? I’m guessing not, but figured I would ask. 

What are some other online games you know of that would be good for this? It could even be something like chess or drawing or whatever. Games where they can meet up by invite ONLY would be great to reduce stranger-danger, with rooms that are only open to kids with the link. I would even pay for this, if needed. They could share gamer tags in the doc beforehand, too, for additional safety (no using real names but still knowing who’s who).

g18lch,gaming,Games through Epic Launcher: Controllers eventually stop working,"Like a lot of people, I've been scooping up Epic's giveaways. One of the first ones I picked up was Slime Rancher, and my kids were briefly obsessed with it. (My son actually finished the main game, which was pretty impressive for a 7-year-old.)

But there's a problem: their games have developed a tendency to stop playing nicely with my controllers. It started with Slime Rancher -- the controls were simply unresponsive. The game registers the controller as connected, but nothing works. If I launch the game through Steam's Big Picture mode, the controller works... *mostly.* It won't register the triggers, which disables the primary function of the game.

Other games have started to follow suit. Everything (the game) responds sluggishly, and won't allow me to change scale. RiME won't work at all with the controller. All of these games worked fine initially, but at some point decided not to. Keyboard controls work fine still, but my kids prefer to use controllers.

It's not specific to one controller. I have two, and both give the same results. They're third-party wired controllers ('cause I can't afford an official Xbox one), and they work fine with games on Steam and Origin and Uplay.

Is anyone else seeing this? Epic games spontaneously deciding they don't like controllers?",3,/r/gaming/comments/g18lch/games_through_epic_launcher_controllers/

g1jf62,gaming,stressing over having too many games?,"hey guys,

so straight to the point, i’m overall a pretty anxious person. i don’t necessarily freak out over pressure, but when i have a lot on my plate i often find myself with this lingering anxiety - due to work, university and surprisingly my games.

while i have the school work stressing me out, work stressing me out, i am also stressed out by the amount of games i have installed on my computer; almost as if they are something on my to-do list, and not just there for some off-time pleasure. i have about 15 games on my PC, but literally only play Minecraft and League of Legends, but i feel this sort of guilt when i don’t play the other games i’ve bought. 

when doing university work, i’ll stress that i need to get around to finishing that one game, and when i’m playing that one game i’ll stress about uni work.

i am just wondering if anyone else has had this sort of mindset and what you did to tackle it. did you uninstall your games or something like this?

thanks guys.",3,/r/gaming/comments/g1jf62/stressing_over_having_too_many_games/

PC continues to be an excellent way to enjoy gaming and it often has more options and better prices than the console counter-parts.

And with all these options you start having many platforms dedicated to specific publishers. So much like what GOG Galaxy is doing (but it's not there yet), I'd love to see a aggregate platform that could house all stores, achievements, libraries, chats and friends under one, coherent roof. Something that would be your one stop for gaming, much like turning on your console in the living-room. Where you can navigate with mouse and keyboard or have a ""Big Picture Mode"" for those who prefer a controller.

In essence, I think the PC is missing its ""gaming hub"". It used to be Steam, but the market just went nuts with dedicated platforms (and some good did come out of it, don't get me wrong).",3,/r/gaming/comments/g217ck/pc_one_platform_to_rule_them_all/

I just thought I would share my experience with the recent shortage on Nintendo switch consoles. I spent 2 hours yesterday looking for a switch that was in stock and couldn't find one anywhere online. I was extremely frustrated, my daughter wants a switch for her birthday in a few months but I didn't want to spend $600 on a switch so I thought I'd get creative.

If you don't mind paying a bit of a premium you can put together a switch console by ordering all the parts for the console seperately. The console by itself is just over $200(these are priced from $200-$300 you'll have to shop around to find a decent deal on them), the joycons vary in price(third party joycons can be found for $45, Nintendo joycons are $80), and a third party dock goes for around $40.

g2vlue,gaming,Help! Dishonored2 Game doesn't launch anymore,"Hello everyone, I'm having a hard time getting my game to launch. I got the game on Steam a while back. I couldn't get it to launch until I found 3 different .exe files, chose the one that said ""Dishonored2.exe"" and ran it as administrator, somehow it worked and I played the game all the way through over a few days without any lag or other issues. I tried to launch it again the same way but it never gets to the start menu. I disabled my graphics driver and it got to the start menu but it was too choppy to actually play. Then finally I went into properties on the .exe file and under compatibility I test ran it and it finally loaded! I tested that 2 more times to make sure it would launch the game and it worked. Then I got a bit carried away and wanted to fix the slow cursor speed. I went into the .cfg configuration file and upped the numbers for cursor speed, then after that, it didn't launch the game like it did before. I changed it back but it still doesn't launch. I even did a system restore. Does anyone have any ideas? My computer: Toshiba satelite s50-c windows10 intel(R) Core(TM) i3-5015U 2 core 12gb RAM 64-bit

*I've tried:* 

    *Reinstalling the game
    *Adjusting the games compatibility in the .exe's properties
    *Running Steam and the game as the Administrator
    *Disabling my graphics card using Device Manager
    *Changing the configuration file in Users&gt;""User""&gt;Saved Games&gt;Arkane Studios&gt;Dishonored 2&gt;Base.

It's just really frustrating because it's a great game and I got it to work a few times. I know my system isn't great but this has been the only game that hasn't been able to launch.

g3697x,gaming,What I want to achieve for video games,"I know this is dumb, but hear me out.

I hear these stories of people having the time of their lives playing video games with their friends and other things like that, so I have made a list of things that I want to achieve.  I am making this post to ask if anyone knows how to achieve these things.  I will be using minecraft as an example because it is just a good example and a lot of things happen in it, though I do not play it much anymore.

1.  I would like to become known in a community and be invested in it, like to know who the best and popular players in the community are.  I would like to be able to make friends in the community.  I heard a story on askreddit about OP joining a small server and making good friends, being invested in it, and such, and had nostalgia about it looking back, and I want to have a good time like that, and I feel like my chance is slipping away as I am 14 years old.  
2. I would like to be actually *good.*   I am terrible at most things I try and want to be actually good, and known by people in the community for that.  There is an allure about stories of people that join a small, say, pvp server and ""rose to the top"" beating the top players and becoming good.  I want to be able to say that I've done that.
3. I would like to play since the beginning in such a community and be able to say I have been in it for years since the beginning.
4. I want to play more AAA games, and be able to understand references, but I don't know where to start.  I want to one day go to like PAX and cosplay or something but I want to get to that level of knowledge first.

How would I achieve these things, and have you?  I know this is a long and dumb post, but any and all reply would be massively appreciated,

g3d2v5,gaming,[Rant] Plants vs Zombies: Battle for Neighbourville,"PvZ garden warfare was and will probably be my favourite game of all time. I started playing when I was 8 and well it was one hell of a game. I was on PC and grinded for hours totalling 1000 hours overall (not played since 2016).

PvZ Garden warfare 2 was good but the introduction of new characters messed with game flow and the new maps created a bias to one team. The old maps were good and each one was unique with objectives and providing an arena for sniper fire and close quarters combat with good places for healers to heal whilst simultaneously attacking. The timings were also on point and you would come face to face with the enemy just at the right place to create a feeling of the tides turning either way.

Some maps (such as Dave’s mansion) offered a constant attack by the zombies whilst the plants battled them defending by sniping and using all sorts of abilities to defend this unique landscape.

Now the new PvZ battle for neighboursville takes PvZ GW2’s problems to a whole new level with even more.

The maps are awful and aren’t in any way memorable. Less time has been spent developing consumer gameplay and more on fine details such as tunnels or grand parts of the map you might see for a few seconds. Each map is incredibly biased to one team and this results in what you’d expect to be a 15 minute battle, a 5 minute one.

The gamemodes suck ass. No real fun and have no real point.

My biggest criticism is that THE CHARACTERS ARE TOO CHILDISH. I know this is meant to be a game that’s targeted at both children and adults and so what they have done is horrible. When sprinting the characters flail around and it’s just eyebleach. I can’t okay the game. The characters shouldn’t even be able to sprint. That’s what the Peashooters first ability is?? Speed boost? Now it’s either op or pointless.

I forgot to mention this before: I didn’t mind the backyard battleground in PvZ GW2 but I found it frustrating having to walk to different parts of the map to do simple things such as matchmaking or changing appearance l. I preferred the original to this that didn’t have it. In Neighboursville they blew that shit out of proportion making what seems to be a whole fairground that you can battle in and stuff. Not only that but it’s fully online so you can’t even do stuff offline.

You have ruined the game I loved.

Although officially this is not part of the GW series it is plain to see that it’s what will (try to) carry on the PvZ 3D 3rd person shooter franchise.",3,/r/gaming/comments/g3d2v5/rant_plants_vs_zombies_battle_for_neighbourville/

- Send villagers/NPCs to farm materials for you to mass gather lots of resources for mass crafting.

- Preferably has online economy of some kind to sell crafted items. Like Path of Exile or MMO auction houses.

Now I would like to fix the issue as we are gaming quite a bit during this quarantine. I’ve searched around for hours looking to find a match to my issues with no luck so I will explain as best as I can below. 

This is what’s happening

-Turn on PS4 &amp; blue light flashes a couple times. Nothing shows on TV screen. Sometimes PS4 shuts off by itself as I’m sure it realizes something is wrong.

-Occasionally after PS4 sits for a few hours I’m able to start up in safe mode (blue light flashes a couple times then turns white or purple ish) and see a screen but I don’t get far as the screen starts to glitch. Not long after it goes black and PS4 shuts itself down. Have tried changing resolution and after the res change is complete PS4 restarts but will not restart properly and will shut down. 

I have tried using different HDMI cables. Have tried 3 other TV’s. Have opened it up and put washers on the 2 bolt clamp thing lol (sorry it’s early) but that seemed to make it worse so I pulled the washers out. Have tried removing hard drive and cleaning then re-installing.

You get the whole ""we're listening"" line and then the developers release content that pushes the game the opposite way players want. This path usually leads to a game bedding is massive overhaul, usually full of what the players asked for over months, and things get better.

It's worked out so far, but I'm considering XB GPU.  The only hitch is that it appears that games are available to play for a certain period of time - same as Netflix's model.  Does that mean that when the game has left the library, it's uninstalled and you can no longer play it?

There was this game I downloaded many years ago off some website I can’t remember the name of but is most likely now nonexistent. I tried to do a search on google for this game but so far nothing is turning up that matches what I can recall.

From my memory this game didn’t have any name on the file, but it was a sort of 3D graphics point and click horror type western game for PC, it looked like it was from the 90’s. Kinda like Nancy Drew style gameplay if I’m not mistaken.

There’s one bit I remember in particular and in the bit you go around exploring this old western looking town, then somehow or another you come across a closet in a building with half of a body hanging from a noose and it only shows up in some lightning flashes. It was quite spooky and from what I can remember the whole town seemed to be abandoned.
If my memory is correct most the buildings and surroundings were like a sort of orange color and the sky was dark purple and spooky looking.

My wife and I have known each other since we were young kids. Like 5 years old. Our parents were best friends growing up so e we spent a lot of time together. 

I’ve always been a gamer, i can remember my dad and his brothers playing NES Hamed while i watched. My papaw would show me various DOS games. I grew up in and around it. 

My wife has not. Her dad was not around and had 2 sisters Ana a younger brother. She didn’t really grow up around or experience it a lot. I can remember her occasionally showing interest in games when groups of people were all sitting around the TV playing and talking about it, taking turns and the like. Games like Spyro or Crash Bandicoot. Even Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater (the OG!). 

We’ve been married for 7 years, together for the last 9.  She’s never shown much interest in joining me in this hobby. We have actually played some “Don’t Starve Together” for the last year or so, she seems to like this type of game.  The harvesting and gathering, setting up our base, etc. but she only likes to play it with me, rather than alone. She said she just doesn’t enjoy it.

With the covid-19 issue she’s seen a lot of people she knows talking about the new animal crossing. She did some research on her own and said she would like to play it!!! 

A game she’s showing independent interest in is something that i not only think is awesome, but want to encourage.  Most of you already know the issue is getting hold of one of these systems right now.

I’ve looked everywhere local to me on the East coast and it’s just.... not doable for me with the prices people want.

g4mh92,gaming,How my grandma got a wii,"This is just something fun I remembered and wanted to share during the current switch shortage. 

Rewind to a week or two after the Wii launched and every major news outlet was constantly reporting on the scarcity of the Wii. My grandma kept asking ""why don't people just go to the store and buy one"" I tried explaining it's so popular that stores don't have them. She would just suggest trying another store. 

I was visiting her house overnight and after dinner she declared we were going to the mall. This was highly abnormal. But we found our way to EB Games. Even more abnormal. She walked up to the counter and asks the clerk ""can I buy a wii machine""? Turns out someone just defaulted on a pre order moments earlier and he just finished putting it into the system. 

To this day my grandma cites this as what you need to do whenever any product storage is on the news. She wonders why people don't just ""go to the store and get one"".

g57eh2,gaming,My recent and new Overwatch experience,"So I was a PS4 player about 2017-2018 and at that time I used to play with my ex who always was complaining about my gaming skills, he always looked at me like I was a newbie and he was the skilled one. Sometimes he even used to yell at me if I made one miserable mistake, and the funny thing is this happened while we were playing normal games. So one day I felt like trying to play ranked games, and I was really surprised because I got placed at Plat rank. Funny thing again? My ex just mocked at me, told me that a fucking rank can't tell how truly skilled I am and I was really done of his toxic behavior, so I stopped playing with him and playing OW ever again. Until these days. 

Fortunately now I'm with someone who always treats me like a queen and due to the lockdown situation we have to stay separate from the other, dealing with a hard long distance relationship. We still try to do things together so I decided to buy Overwatch on PC to play together. I'm also not really used to play with keyboard and mouse because my laptop has less than a year and I've been always a console player. Welp, some weeks ago the screen broke up and of course I can't go outside and I don't really know how to fix it. But it still works, so to play in a comfortable way I started to use a xbox one controller I had. We decided to play ranks today, and lol, I was placed at diamond playing tank. But the funniest thing was we got matched with some jerks after the positioning games. They were giving us order like playing some specific champ and when we told them to please pick an active support, they started to insult me and saying I bought a diamond account for sure. Like, wtf? I literally got placed diamond some minutes ago. That toxic behavior reminded me when I used to play with my ex and how people like him can't just try to have fun and stop being so flamer. I do know some people is competitive at ranked games, but it just tilts me when this happens even in normal games. Why can't some people have fun? Why do they always have to insult, give orders and can't accept their own mistakes? However I won't stop playing this time, I got someone that made me feel like I was really good at a videogame for the 1st time and I enjoy playing with him, that's what a game is for, enjoying gaming with other people and have a good attitude.",3,/r/gaming/comments/g57eh2/my_recent_and_new_overwatch_experience/

I don't know if its only me but most FPS games that have come out in the past couple of years come out with less and less maps for multiplayer. And on top of that they usually don't play very well.

Why is it for mostly triple A titles releasing games with very few maps and for the most part they don't play well. 

I've always thought that map design should be the most important thing for FPS Multiplayers but that seems to be the most neglected. Is it just not enough play testers? or could it be the people who are actually testing the maps and not giving enough or not the right feed back? Or is it just me.

Not all games are like this like for example Rainbow Six Siege I think did a tremendous job on their maps and style and generally play very well.",3,/r/gaming/comments/g5dw9b/new_fps_games_and_maps/

When I used to play them more often, I would always prefer Terraria for a decent amount of reasons. I think it has a lot to do with my preferences in general.  


Terraria is like a combination of a sandbox game, and a sprite action-adventure one. It feels way more like a video game than Minecraft does. It also contains a lot of features and options that MC doesn't. The scenery (**regardless** of being a 2-D game) and worlds are also better imo.

I was wondering if anyone could recommend any open world games where there is any form of territory conquest, possibly for extra income (in game)?

The reason I'm posting this is because I've met quite a few people who didn't think of this and it might improve some gaming habitats. Hell, I've been gaming for 20 years and just figured it out last year.

  
If you deal with warm rooms due to having multiple electronics working at once, I recommend getting a floor/tower fan and placing it by your bedroom door to blow the air OUT of your bedroom. 

The rest of the house, the larger space, will dissipate the heat more evenly, and the AC vent in your bedroom will now constantly supply a flow of cool air that runs over you. Speaking from experience, I've noticed at least a couple degrees difference, which during the Summer, is a HUGE difference. Think of it just like a computer case. You don't want the fans blowing the air AROUND the chassis, you want the fans blowing the hot air OUT.

TL:DR I want to buy a friend in Canada a laptop under $400CAD but I don't know which stores / models to look at as I live in the UK. Can you help?

I was wondering if someone is able to help me help a friend whose got an absolute potato for a laptop. He wants to play with me and my friends some RTS titles, like Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, which aren't the most demanding games but his laptop can't handle it.

He's my best friend who lives in a very rural part of Canada by himself so his laptop is his life. He's not able to upgrade because of the uncertainty about his job due to coronavirus. This situation is really hitting him hard and we want to help to keep his mental health up.

I want to do a collection with a couple of other people and see if we can afford something that will allow him to play with us but there's a couple of issues and I wondered if you could help. 


- He lives in Canada, we live in the UK. I don't know what shops are best to look at for laptops. 

- The laptop doesn't need to be a gaming laptop but good enough to play age of empires DE. Anyone got a model they recommend that can handle that?

- It sadly has to be a laptop because he is moving shortly to the US (I'd get him a desktops otherwise)

- Our budget is extremely tight ($400CAD) and I don't know if there's something out there within our price range.

- Happy to buy used/refurbished if they deliver. (He's about 3 hours from the nearest very small town).

g794sc,gaming,I am looking for a video game I used to play,"(sorry for my english I'm french)

I searched for hours online and can't find it. I think I played it around 2002. This is what I remember for sure:

- It was a 3D game, on PC
- The game was made of scenes, or mini-games
- In one of those scenes, one could play around with juggling maces
- In another scene, there was a wire loop game with electricity, like this: https://youtu.be/ATXhXl1KNCU?t=445

That is all I have in memory. I already searched on google with all the possible keywords, no luck.

If someone knows what game I am talking about, I would be very pleased if you would tell me.

Thank you in advance.",3,/r/gaming/comments/g794sc/i_am_looking_for_a_video_game_i_used_to_play/

I have a Ryzen 7 2700 overclocked to 3.6mhz paired with an RTX 2060 Super and 16gb of RAM.

But the thing is i also play a lot of single player AAA games wich get me nowhere near the 240 fps. I feel that the amount of games that would justify the 240 hz monitor is limited and that the higher image quality of the IPS panel would be preferable, but i feel like i would be missing out on the higher refresh rate in fps titles.

g81dp6,gaming,Yes i know these games are old. While Need for Speed Most Wanted 2005 was the best game of its series Prostreet was the best idea of the series.," Personally if you ask me Prostreet got a lot of things right like its soundtrack being probably the most perfect one for the game its in out of all of the other games in the series. It featured a wide array of cars that could all be fully customised with a great paint editor. The game even had a totally awesome mode called Speed Challenge.

&amp;#x200B;

**This all sounds good but how did it go wrong?**

The bosses where pretty trash tbh. All of them posed hardly any threat to the player apart from in the drift mode and random AI's in the career mode posed a big threat to the player. Secondly the physics felt worse than they did in previous games and even then i think the game would of benefited from a simcade like handling model. To add onto this if you got stage 4 parts for the slower cars for like a honda civic you could pretty easily reach 250 mph and sustain it with only 500 -ish HP. While then very high powered cars got effected by the same 250 mph speed cap. The game especially in speed challenge also reused the same map just with the event being shorter or long in length which made things a bit repetitive.

This is all i could come up with there might be more problems but i think i got them all. The game had minor issues like cars breaking apart weirdly when they flip over but i over looked those intentionally.",3,/r/gaming/comments/g81dp6/yes_i_know_these_games_are_old_while_need_for/

A few examples:

Pretty sure I got a rare core crystal from the Elder Aracho fight. I used Rex to bond with the rare core, and received the blade named, Perun.

**Perun- Attribute ice (Base Stats)**

**Role ATK**

**Auto-Atk 15**       **Phys Def 10%**

**Block Rate 5%      Ether Defense 15%**

**Critical Rate 19%     Strength 15**

**Affinity Chart 9/44 ( these are the blades ""abilities"" are already unlocked)**

**Dexterity Mod 10%**

**Cooldown (?) 3 ( I have no clue as to what cool down is for, unless it is for specials, but what could the 3 be for seconds? I'm unsure on that as well).**

**Trust E ( pretty sure all new blades start with the ranking of E. The way it works in my mind, well it tells you in-game, but the more you battle with the selected blade the higher the trust between me and the blade grows; now, how many battles it takes to get the trust level up, I have no fucking clue, but yeah as of this writing the trust level I have with Perun is at an E, and Pyra's is at a C. The highest level it goes to is, I would like to think ( with my big bwain) is that it goes up to the level S.)**

**Specials:**

1. **Cold Sever- Use ice ether to attack with a series of high speed stabs. ( The special is located on the right of the battle screen with the roman numerals representing which ever attack that I can unleash at the current moment; visually cold sever just has me hitting the B button ""as hard as I can"" and doing damage of roughly mid-400ish.)**
2. **Punishment Strike- Swing your weapon around above your head to create a giant block of ice.** 
3. **Extinction Icicle- Create a giant ice lance and use it in a extra powerful charge. ( Swear to god, these are literally shonen attacks. )**
4. **Snowflake of Judgement- After a series of trifling cuts, unleash a giant pillar of ice. (For the life of me, I have no idea as why my screens up on this attack. I was looking forward to seeing this one too. )**

**Blade Arts**

1. **Accuracy up- Increases Accuracy**
2. **Nullifies Reaction- Nullifies one's reaction**
3. **Debuff Cancel- Cancel debuffs from enemies**

**Battle Skills**                                                         

1. **Defender Lv 1 - Deal 150% more and take 20% less damage if ally has low hp (hit points/ health) or is felled.**

2. **Silent Spear lv 1-Reduces aggro drawn from auto-attacks by 30%**

**Field Skills** 

1. **Ice Mastery Lv 1 - The power of an Ice Blade** 
2. **Ancient Wisdom Lv 1 - Knowledge of ancient civilizations, used to decode writing, etc.**
3. **Chivalry Lv 1- A knight's sense for melting out justice. Skill exclusive to Perun.**

g9gkct,gaming,Unpopular opinion: Indivisible was a great game.,"***MAJOR SPOILERS FOR INDIVISIBLE AHEAD, DON'T READ UNLESS YOU'VE COMPLETED IT***



Yes, you read the title right. I honestly believe it was a beautiful game, really entertaining and well written. Here's my take on why:



Gameplay:
This game resembles a Metroidvania, but it also expands on it, as encountering an enemy triggers the combat mode, rather than just letting you battle them in the overworld. The platforming is creative, great and honestly, quite fun, given that there are so many things you can combine to get to certain places. Of course, this can cause confusion, given that a lot of things can riddle your mind and you'll eventually find yourself wondering what to do (I know I did). The parrying system in the game is great and feels satisfying whenever you actually land one, and the upgrades you can get for your defence favour it even more, as parrying lets you restore life at a certain level. The attacking system is also quite fun, as a lot of different possibilities open up and you can experiment with so many of them. There are also some nice pace changers, such as only being able to hit enemies effectively by juggling, and stuff of sorts. Of course, there's the bad side of the coin, like there being no game overs and just reloading at the lat checkpoint, that feels really vague and cheap, and I didn't like it. I also didn't like that you could just infinite an enemy with Zebei's bow before finishing them off, seemed cheap as well, I would've liked if those kinds of moves took you to battle directly.



Story:
I LOVED the story. I especially loved Dhar's redemption arc before he sacrificed himself to let Ajna unlock her second-to-last phase in terms of potential. It is well written, every character is lovable and plays a part in the game, and it really gets to you when it means to. A really touching story that lets us see the maturing of a young girl who only wanted to avenge her father and ended up saving the world and allowing Kala to realise what she's doing is wrong. Of course, some rough patches are here and there, like Princess Mary being a boss because ""hurr durr Kala bad and possessive"", I honestly would have liked it better if she had attacked consciously before realising her mistakes.



Sound &amp; Graphics:
No words needed, beautiful art, good voice acting, great music, all of wuich will forever hold a place in my heart. 
Replayability: 



This is more of a ""meh"" thing, although the ending was beautiful, I found it unsatisfying that all that changes is Ajna's skin and a few extra side quests being added in. However, I found this game so lovable I still wish to complete the game again.
Verdict:



Although a few bumps are here and there, there's no denying Indivisible is a beautiful game, as well as fun and entertaining in a consistent manner. I seriously don't see how people have all that many problems with this game. Yes, it is confusing at first, but as you get the hang of it, more possibilities open up. The story is not too complex but not too simple either and the characters, though most of them don't grow in any meaningful way, are still likeable and not close to annoying.

Since then i have played 49 hours of it and haven't stopped and Days Gone is my third favorite game behind RDR 2 and Borderlands 2. This game was in a way of words breathe taking, its engaging immersive down to earth feel coupled with its in my opinion fantastic story by the end i wanted more. And yes playing threw a roughly 36 hour campaign and then wanting MORE sounds strange but i just felt that invested in what Days Gone had to offer and most of the characters in Days Gone didn't feel dull or boring (quote most) and they just added to a more compelling story. Days Gone won my heart and you should try it for yourself.

g20cv8,gaming,Looking for a game with lots of exploration,"See, I have a vierd taste for videogames. I own more than 500 games on Steam and I constantly try new ones but I only get hooked on a game 1-2 times a year. I've been trying to formulate my taste for years but did not succeed, so I decided to ask the community for recommendations.

I am looking for a game that has big amount of content to explore. The game can be any of genre or age.

  
Here is some criteria I am looking for:

* Hand made environments (open world or levels, doesn't matter), no procedural generation
* Non linearity - something that made me very dissapointed in DS3 comparing to DS1&amp;2
* Some gameplay besides exploration, not a walking simulator.
* Lore and background, if possible. 

Games I have enjoyed recently:

* Dark Souls (1-2, not 3)
* Hollow Knight
* Arx Fatalis
* RE:2 Remake

I know this sounds very vague, but I tried my best to express what I am looking for.

Therefor i prepared some Question and if you would answer just one Questions or at least discuss the topic in the Comments i would be glad to hear what your thoughts area about microtransaktions.

And here are my Questions:

Have you ever bought something In-Game, a DLC or an Season pass and if yes what was it and in what game have you Bought it?

Do you prefer Loot Boxes or an In-Game Shop?

Do you think Loot boxes are Gambling and should it be completly removed from Games?

Would you say that a Battle pass helps to keep a Game alive?

Do you prefer buying a Season pass or do you rather buy DLC\`s separately?

Would you like to Pay more for games but get everything in game and all additional Content for Free and if so, what should be the price?

Do you think you get a good value for your money you spend on Microtransactions and if not please explain why?

Do you think you get an unfinished game when Microtransactions and buyable addons are included?

&amp;#x200B;

Another Question i wanted to ask is what you guys think of new playable Charakters and i dont mean Charakters which are visuell diffrent i mean Charakters with  individual abilities like in Rainbow or For Honor. Do you also think that this could be seen as Pay-to-Win because some Abilities are better than others.

Why do people like this game so much to this day? EVERY time I play this game something goes wrong.

Just playing through the story? WHOOPS! Quest is glitched, can't continue playing without going back 5 or more quests to fix a glitch that should have been patched out by now.

Thieves Guild? WHOOPS! Despite only burning three hives, you burnt them all down cause we said so. Decided to continue that quest? WHOOPS! You left the ruins at the end and now you can't get back to the place you were before and your companions have disappeared making the quest unbeatable.

Companions? WHOOPS! The funeral glitched and now all those NPCS are stuck there.

Wanna play through the dawnguard quests? WHOOPS! You accidentally found the island before you were supposed to. Glitch your way through the fence or never complete it. Have fun!

No matter what I do in this game, something goes wrong and the lore and all the quests feel so samey and boring. And replaying them gets really boring quick.

I haven't even tried attempting the dragonborn DLC for these reasons. I fear that the moment I start something is going to go wrong and soft-lock me.

Hell, most Bethesda games do this to me. Fallout included. Have I just pissed Todd off personally? Am I doomed? Why do people like these messed up, unpolished, glitchy games?

fupelg,gaming,"i want to get into gaming and i have a lot of questions, pls help","Here's the thing, games outside of Mario never really catched my eye when i was younger, but now i'm 19 and starting to get interested in gaming .

It all started a couple months ago when a friend told me that there are some games where you actually follow a storyline, and as a big reader this really  caught my atention, my mind was blown when i found out.  I've slowly started to become a bit  more intersted in games when i heard about Assassin's Creed Odyssey (i've always been a mythology kid)  and now with the new Animal Crossing game coming out, i desperately want to play it, and since I've never owned any console (aside from my 2007 nintendo ds) i've been thinking about  buying a Nintendo Switch, since it's more convenient for me because of its portability and i'm able to conect it to my tv (I mainly want to play acnh tho). 

What I'm trying to say is, I'm buying a Nintendo Switch after this whole corona thing, and I want to dip my toes in storytelling games  (aside from botw), the ones that really interest me are  Assassin's Creed and The Witcher, 

1.  so can i play the versions that exist for Nintendo Switch even though I've never played any other before? 
2. Do you have any other suggestions?

Personally, I just can’t manage to stay interested in it. The entirety of the game to me feels like riding your horse between generic NPC conversations in order to fight (performing mind numbingly easy parries and dodges), talk to another person or grab this thing, or walk around holding L2 so your witcher sense can point out what you should be doing for you. At over halfway through the game, I haven’t struggled with an enemy or segment and rarely even look at my health since I’m virtually never worried about actually losing a battle. I like the way they handle the lore of different monster types and races, as well as the overall music and aesthetic of the world, but the sense of progression in this game just isn’t satisfying enough for me to finish it.

g0pyl0,gaming,Why is gaming so competive?,"I remember a few years back people would hop onto a cod game just to have some fun and get a few kills and relax, people played overwatch to have fun and mess around with different heroes, people played games like those just to have some fun, mess around, have fun in voice chat etc. Now it seems like even in the casual modes they all try so hard to win, only care about winning and kills, it seems like it's not a fun little community anymore. Every match of a popular multiplayer game is just a bunch of people only caring about wins and their stats rather than caring about fun. People play overly competitively in casual modes and it just doesn't feel as fun anymore. If you would compare overwatch in 2016 to this year it's way less casual and simple, even in quick play everyone is probably sweating their nuts off to win and use the most op character and if you would compare the old cods to the new ones, the community just isn't as fun anymore.

g7iluz,gaming,I Am Upset At The Final Fantasy VII Remake,"Final Fantasy VII was my first and favorite RPG of all time. I love that game so damn much and this remake is not as good. Idk if its all the nostalgia that makes the old one seem better, but I think this new one could have been way better. I feel like the combat system is great, however the actual combat is kind of unbalanced. Do the enemies have ATBs? It seems like I am constantly being blasted for 1-2k a hit when my max health is like 10k while there is no in-depth gear system and the items that are offered do shit for stats. And limits missing because an enemy flies or jumps out of the way? I only get to summon when I am nearly dead? They made a really fluid combat system and then bogged it down with stupid AI teammates that barely do a thing on their own and are constantly in harms way and ATB bars that require you to equip a few new types of materia SPECIFICALLY to make it work in the player's favor. So I'm also filling up materia slots just for regular combat. I can't take it.

The story was awesome and I like that they added some new elements. I enjoyed watching all the events play out and couldn't wait to move the story along. However, it is again bogged down hard with pointless dialogue and cuts between cinematics that should have just been tied together. For example the cinematic with Madam M in her shop, then the player takes control of Aerith for 15 seconds and walks around slowly while Madam M walks down the hallway and slowly makes her way to starting more dialogue/cutscene. It would have been better as a movie since there is so little gameplay/combat action otherwise. And having to go through chapters over and over every tine I want to revisit an area after beating it, why?

I feel like the more they tried to drag this thing out, the more stupid trivial crap they added in as well. Sometimes it seemed like I was playing a game full of mini games, like having Aerith ride around on the hand cranes to lower ladders. It just felt like filler.

In the end, I feel like the main elements of the game were poorly executed and filler was added to make up for the lack of combat and mass of storyline to get dozens of hours out of the first 3 hours of the original.

I wanna know what you guys think though. I am just ranting because of all the hours I just spent playing it and trying to get through to the end.",27,/r/gaming/comments/g7iluz/i_am_upset_at_the_final_fantasy_vii_remake/

fugcnt,gaming,What is wrong with gaming industry,"This is my first post here and I made my account because I want to know if there are people who feel like me.
All the AAA GAMES Destiny2,Division 2, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Anthem,etc what is wrong with this people? What's wrong with the players also? We spent thousands maybe on games and we still accept s#it to be thrown in our eyes. ??!!We still accept lies after lies and we pay only to get stressed not relaxed ,and to be only and only beta testers because all the games now are not even finished after years since they are available.??
Destiny was something fun and far from perfect but was fun, PvP was fun, then they ruined all the fun SBMM CBMM ,useless changes, lowering TTK, accepting cheaters as part of the game,banning cheaters after years not immediately,etc .With Curse of Osiris dlc they removed access from strikes for non dlc players, then they gave that back because they seen people leaving. Big mistake to force people buying something they maybe don't need. Then added ""Pinnacle"" or pineapple weapons on PvP. I tried for 1 year to get the Luna's Howl,never got to 2100 points on PvP. After trying 1 year I gave up and stopped playing a game which became a pay to others to carry you, and by paying I mean hundred of dollars ,who the hell will pay hundred of dollars for a weapon?? Who?? A mad person?Maybe someone who are very rich or someone who don't know how hard money are made from working. After Forsaken which was the best dlc, bungie lost a customer,that was me,and many others too. In 2019 I managed to get the Luna's Howl and the SMG but was too late ,already don't care about that game. They are lying customers and don't give a s#it on their customers ,so why should I care and support such a company? No thanks!!

Anthem a broken game sold as a full and polished game, but was a lie ,a disaster,lack of content ,full of bugs, network errors every 10 minutes,unplayable. Every customer who payed for the game,deserved at that time a full refund or another free game at the customer choice from EA or BioWare. I can tell now I have much more fun on Anthem than I have in destiny 2. And they fixed some things on the game but still no content.
I can't wait for the revamp of Anthem to became available.

The Division 2, a good game, a good vision, Ubisoft was always on 1 place on my list and I liked their games , but Division 2 was a mess also. They fixed some of the bugs ,the game was playable after few months,but why to make available a game when it's not fully tested and is not finished? Was sold as a full game but was another work in progress and must be sold as an unfinished product at half of the price or even lower. Yes I know studios want only the money but is not working like that at least for me.
At some point I tried division 2 PvP, what a disaster, definitely PvP don't belong in Division 2,or must be fully reworked. Movement is too slow, only 1 build and 2 or 3 talents worked on PvP and not in 1v1 ,PvP on division means only team shot. About PvP I will stop here. So I refused to play that like Warframe has PvP but no one will play ever. First dlc was available for free for all the players which was nice. After 1 year the game still needed some fixes and minor changes but the developers prepared a surprise for all the community. A revamped Division 2, so a new game, a payed dlc, only 2 talents an all your build and not 6 or whatever we had before TU8,split the community in 2 ,dlc players and no dlc players , different stats for dlc and non dlc players, a dlc full of bugs and glitches,a broken scaling system, NPC's were God's with millions of armor and millions of damage,the player was paper and damage almost inexistent. An entirely new game UNPLAYABLE. so they removed what they fixed until TU7 and made another garbage as TU8. After almost 1 month since Warlords of NY dlc, they admitted the game scaling is broken and the game is underperforming. And they removed some of the NPC's armor and damage but still the game is not enjoyable anymore, NPC'S have no tactics and are very stupid. Lack of the build diversity is in first place, and attention the developers said they will do changes in TU8 because the game have a lack of build diversity. REALLY? ARE YOU JOKING ME? I am the 2 years old kid and you my older brother who scares me that is a monster under my bad?? Really?? Shame on lazy developers and greedy companies which want to make money from nothing by selling us s#it and lying us in face and spitting us after we preorder their lies. After we give them money they still lie us and don't care about us. 
I don't want dlc for free but I want a game I payed for to be fun and to entertain me not to stress me and make me mad. Maybe are still a lot of things to say but I will stop here with division.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey, I liked and still like and play that game but, they didn't fixed the bugged mission where some goods won't spam and you can't finish ever that mission. In my opinion Odyssey was the best game I played ,graphics animations,tactics,etc, and I don't know if Ubisoft will ever make another game at least as good as Odyssey.
But for their dears customers Ubisoft made available a free weekend Odyssey,and with that the Ezio Suit from AC3 so a legacy skin which I understand some of the community was requested some time ago but the developers said never will be available. The skin was available via Ubisoft Club and all you had to do was to play or log in to Odyssey on the free weekend.
Me and maybe other many people have missed the event, a 2 -3 days event,some because of the situation in the world with this new virus, some because they work far from home,some because they simply didn't knew that. So after I invested more than 250 hours in that game ,bought the game, all the dlc's I am locked out and I will never get that ,but a good thing is the players who don't give a s#it on Odyssey and played the demo ,they have the skin while the ones who play every week or every day can't have it. So wtf is wrong with this people? What is wrong in their brain with such decisions? Yes they made the skin available on the free weekend in the hope they will milk more money from new customers who came from playing the demo. Me and many others don't care anymore for Ubisoft ,we already did our job which was to make them rich and now the studio will spit on our faces. Nice . Well ubisoft too ,with that decision lost me as a customer.

Finally, what I learned in the last 2 or 3 years? Video gaming industry is a toxic environment where only the money count and not the customer. Video game was made to entertain us not to stress is even more than we are after work or after all the problems we have. Now days are made only for some people to get rich and us we pay and move on and pay for other trash and so on because we don't know our rights. Yes we have rights. Companies also have.
So , NEVER pre order, wait some time even 1 year until buying a game, never buy from the store if you don't want to support a company who don't deserve it,buy only from second hand the internet is full. Be smart like me and keep your money in your wallet don't waste them. 
Sure if I want to support a company who deserve that I will buy the game without question but I don't see anymore a company to support. I spent a lot of money on games but that time is over for me 2 years ago. I buy only second hand or if a game is on sale for 5-10 bucks but not 50 or 100$.
Sony another greedy company but I will not detail them now .
Don't judge me but I feel cheated with every new game every new day every new month.
Now I regret I updated my ps4 firmware years ago and I didn't hacked it to play free games now. 

TLDR  gamers are the cow and the studios the milking machine. Games are sold unfinished and we pay only to be the beta testers . Personally at this point I can't see a reason to support a gaming company when they sell us s#it and tell are roses.

Thanks!! God bless us all!!",26,/r/gaming/comments/fugcnt/what_is_wrong_with_gaming_industry/

This is unrealistic and just ruins the gameplay for me. It makes sense in halo/apex since the lore supports the option but not in most shooters.

fwyzxl,gaming,Looking for a new game with NO LOOT,"I used to love games with tons of loot. Managing it and trying to max everything out, inching up and getting stronger, it was fun. 

I'm getting older now and I can't seem to stand it much. Granted I sunk a fair share of time into Destiny 2 when it came out; but I had a good group of people to play with that kept me going. I did beat Borderlands 3 and really enjoyed it...but I ran through it without much thought about loot and did away with it when the main story ended. Other than that...

I've tried to get into so many other games, and it seems the only ones I enjoy now are games without looting systems. I love the COD campaigns (I know, I'm the odd one out). Gears is awesome (I don't give a crap about collectibles). Crackdown was a cool take on the open world task type game. Tomb Raider is fun, as is Uncharted (again, can't think too much about the collectibles and what not). Titanfall 2 was killer. Sometimes I like world building type games but there has to be an end (played Frostpunk not long ago, it was good). You get my drift...

Ive tried getting into Tom Clancy type games and it's just kill, loot, stare at your crap, repeat. Fallout... shudder...that's a nightmare. Used to love games like Divinity...cant get through an hour of it now. Final fantasy was my youth...havent been able to play it since XIII and that was a struggle. Online PVP/FPS...hell no. Just anything where you go do something, then stop to sift through all the crap in your inventory before you move on...it loses me. I want action, and I want STORY that keeps me engaged. I want to move seamlessly from one thing to another without the constant stopping. I've got a job with long hours, 4 kids, a wife, and other hobbies...I want to enjoy the time I have gaming and actually be able to finish the game in a reasonable amount of time. Is that too much to ask?

So...any recommendations?


EDIT: After reading some of the recommendations (thanks!) I can narrow this down a bit more. 

I don't like horror. 

I lose interest in open world games where you pretty much choose to do whatever you want (Tom Clancy anything, Far Cry, Watch Dogs, Assassin's Creed...maybe it's just everything UbiSoft lol...Witcher, RDR2, FFXV, Fallout are games that come to mind). I think it's just too grindy for a perfectionist personality. I like more linear storytelling.

Loot CAN be ok if it's tacked on and I can ignore it...the issue is where it becomes vital. Something like Strange Brigade (tried it the other day)...you could burn through a level in half an hour easy. BUT, if you don't loot your character stays weak and you're screwed, so the levels are made 2,3,4 times longer just scrounging every corner for junk. This is annoying. Tomb Raider has started to go down this path too...

RTS war type games are good...but I think I've played pretty much everything worth playing lol.

g87ooj,gaming,What Game(s) do you Keep Coming Back To?,"Just like there are movies we’ve seen dozens of times or shows that we watch over and over again; what game(s) do constantly keep drawing you back to them? For me there are two:  
  
Octopath Traveler - There’s something about this game that keeps pulling me back in. I only ever play for a couple hours at a time but it’s a joy to replay each little chapter with new team combinations. I love tinkering with different strats and team compositions. Heck, there are even times where I just turn the game on to talk to random villagers. I’ve sunk hundreds of hours into this game and it never gets old.  
  
Super Meat Boy - Think I beat this game 100% on every available platform. Superb platformer and it’s extremely addicting shaving off seconds of time from your personal speed runs on each level.  
  
Edit: It’s probably too late for this as the post might be on its way out but I urge people to submit single player games as opposed to multiplayer games. It’s easy to see why a multiplayer game draws you back in because of the competitive nature to them.",26,/r/gaming/comments/g87ooj/what_games_do_you_keep_coming_back_to/

(if anybody here has never heard/played it, highly recommend it, it's 20% off on Steam right now)

g8nw02,gaming,"UNPOPULAR OPINION: The ""Vac is Vac"" or ""Once a cheater always a cheater."" Saying s a seriously stupid way to think and it's almost just as bad as cheating.","The gaming community as a whole is full of wide-spread and diverse ways of playing games, gaming genres, and opinions. And before you assume, NO, cheating is not an acceptable form of gaming, ESPECIALLY in competitive matchmaking, as it is usually only fun for the cheater, and it's almost always a very conceited and shameful way of playing. Cheating in singleplayer games is fine, cheating in custom matches with friends is fine imo. But some people with VAC bans on their steam accounts receive things like, death threats, hateful messages, and they even get kicked from games even if the VAC ban is upwards of 5 years old. 

The ""VAC is VAC"" and ""Once a cheater, always a cheater"" sayings are extremely close-minded and horrible, and frankly, almost as bad as actually cheating in an online game. People change, and it seems like nobody is accepting of that in the gaming community. I know that if I had a VAC ban on my account from when I was a stupid kid, I wouldn't want to be judged from a mistake I made 10 years ago. And I know I'm going to get downvoted to hell for thinking that people can learn from mistakes and not everything is linear.

Feel free to maybe open my mind to WHY these sayings make sense, but to me, they don't and I will give some examples. Somebody robs a convenience store because they might need money or live in a hostile environment that has tainted the way they view society or morals (representing players that lose in games and never see one win and get bullied and beaten on for ""sucking"" even being vote kicked out of matches for a losing streak. So they resort to cheating.), they get rightfully punished, and 10 years down the line, they are denied the ability to even socialize with people or even become a functioning member of society because of said mistake, yet they have learned, changed and are now a better person. 

Time and time again, in movies and literature we see a hero, that used to be a villain or has made a horrible mistake, like Peter Parker being too self-absorbed to listen to his Uncle leading to his untimely death, but have been forgiven because they have learned from that mistake. And we applaud this sort of writing, but when it comes to the real world, our narrow outlooks, prevent us from understanding these things. Again, this is just my opinion, and I know that nobody is going to agree, I just had to get this off of my chest.

EDIT: To clarify, I agree with bans and punishment, and everything that comes with it UNTIL the player is unable to play due to constant harassment, death threats etc. I personally don't struggle with such things but I have seen it happen and I think it's an issue.",26,/r/gaming/comments/g8nw02/unpopular_opinion_the_vac_is_vac_or_once_a/

g1536i,gaming,Call of Duty : RANT Ops,"Why the hell are older COD games so freaking expensive on Steam?

The first call of duty ever made, in 2003 for God's sake, is 20$ on Steam. 20$!!!!!! For a game released when i was 4 years old! Then every COD prior to black ops 1 is also 20$. 

Then black ops 1 itself, released 10 years ago, is 40$ on steam as of writing this, and no offers or discounts whatsoever. 

Then MW3 is also 40$ as well as MW remastered, but then every COD game from black ops 2 onward is 60$. Are you kidding me? A game from 2012 is still 60$? Even Tomb Raider 2013 can be had for 3$ during a steam sale. 3 freaking bucks!

 Okay i get that some people still play them for the multiplayer and stuff, but i also didn't know Activision had the similar greediness of EA if not more.

I don't know about others' morals or opinions, but to me a game that was released 5+ years ago should not be that expensive, and that's just the vanilla game without any DLCs or extra add-ons. And the thing is i'm not even much of a multiplayer guy, i'm more of a campaign and zombies guy and i play solo a lot. Even in multiplayer j mostly play vs. Bots because i'm not that good, so there's no way i'm paying 60$ for the game with the campaign to play just once (which i already did on Xbox but now i'm on PC so i don't want to play it again) and one of the most hated zombie maps in COD:zombies. I would get black ops 3 but it's also 60$ vanilla and i can't spend that amount of money right now.

If someone from Activision could see this and maybe hopefully cut the prices of their older COD games at least in half if not more, and maybe have additional discount offers from time to time.

TL:DR - older call of duty games are not fairly priced at all and they should be waaay discounted if they're 5+ years old in my opinion.

Thank you for your time.",25,/r/gaming/comments/g1536i/call_of_duty_rant_ops/

g1pwwk,gaming,How to manage multiple games at the same time?,"For years now I've been playing only one single player game at a time. I start a game, play it from start to finish and only then start another game. However, I often feel burnt out, and I think it might be because I stick to only one game at a time, which is often a long one.

I find it difficult to prevent burnout on long games. Currently I'm playing The Witcher 3, and even though I really love the game, after 60 hours in, I'm feeling burnt out at times. I'm also getting the itch to play other stuff, but I'm afraid of starting other games and inadvertently abandoning the awesome game that's The Witcher 3 in the process. At the same time it's a gigantic game and I feel like some breaks from time to time would help keep me interested all the way through.

Do you ever play multiple single player games at a time? How do you manage that? Is it difficult to keep switching between different games, with different stories, control schemes... etc? Or do you just stick to only one game before starting another one?

P.S.: I'm referring to single player games, since that's what I play almost exclusively (although I'm thinking about breaking this pattern and introducing multiplayer into my gaming routine).",25,/r/gaming/comments/g1pwwk/how_to_manage_multiple_games_at_the_same_time/

g64umq,gaming,I suck at multiplayer games,"I am 24 and have been playing all sorts of games since I was a kid. I have always had a nice PC because of my IT hobby and played every game that I could get my hands on. From MMORPG, RTS, FPS to MOBA. For more than a decade, I have played games. I acquired great mechanical skill. When playing an FPS I will hit those flicks 95% of the time. When playing RTS I will build my base quick and micromanage my troops fast. In MMORPG's I will do raids for days and succeed on the highest difficulty.

But somehow... When I play against humans. I always suck. I always get bottom of the leaderboards. I get picked off from a spot I did not count on. I get swarmed in strategy games. I get tower dived. I will get curb stomped in WoW PvP. No matter how much I play. I literally think my brain is incapable of thinking strategy or more than 1 step ahead of my opponent.

I see my friends fragging away, making amazing plays and getting high ranks. Leaving me in awe with my silver,bronze or some other low rank. Me, the guy cheering them on from the bottom.

Anyone else feel like this? I am always the worst player of all my gamer friends. Luckily I learned to play games for fun and not mind the K/D, which is always around 0.5 :).

Side note; Luckily there are amazing singleplayer games which I enjoy immensely. Also, AMA

When to hide/fall back, when to push forward, how to sneak and stay undiscovered or in other ways surprise your opponents. In school I wasn’t good in team sports. Usually because I’ve never been particularly athletic (because of my low energy and fear of getting hurt). But I was also a shitty tactics planner. How the hell do you plan game tactics? Not even when I play video games, can I figure out how to plan my moves to win. I’ve always felt like I sucked when I play video games, (though I haven’t done it very much,so there’s that). I can even suck at playing board games like chess (but I think that’s a patience issue, I get bored of thinking too hard...) I’m sorry this post is such a mess but I’m too tired to make it more coherent. Even when it’s a game that’s as new to my opponents as it is to me I perform worse than the others. Why, just why is that? What is it that makes me so bad at games? Is it because I’m shy? Because I have low self-confidence? I just want to end this post by confessing that I am, writing all of this because my teammates kicked me off my cs-go game. But I’m so done with being shit at this point. How do I get better?

ftoh6k,gaming,How I think the PS4 Controller Layout is Better for FPS.,"I just realised HOW the PS4 joystick layout is Better than xobx.

First; ive allways mained on ps4 for various reason's, But have played xbox and understand the apeal. Most people tend to say that the layout xbox has is better, and ive failed to have any argument in the past to counter this statement and thought it must just be their personal prefrance.

Most Windows controllers AND even many aftermarket PS4 contollers apply the Xbox method too for players rather than the Playstaion way. but why? comfort wise i could understand for bigger hands and all, But not for a FPS in general.

Ive realised this because if you play claw, (which I've become better at, and have naturally started doing over the past year) You are use to hitting the D Pad (Arrrows) with your left pointing finger, That way keeping your thumb on the movement stick for overall better control.

in games like Apex Legends where you need to heal with the up arrow, it greatly improves your game, and so you can heal while keeping moving, Giving you that slight but promising advantage.

It seems to me this just simply wouldnt work on Xbox. You would need to drop your thumb over from your movement stick, or even from your aim stick, because your pointing finger simply couldn't cross reach that far.",24,/r/gaming/comments/ftoh6k/how_i_think_the_ps4_controller_layout_is_better/

2. Bloodbourne
3. Yakuza 0
4. Undertale
5. Resident Evil 4 (this is an example I believe of an older game that's just as fun to a new player now as it was when released).

fwi0px,gaming,[Help wanted] I keep restarting games to get it just perfect,"I wish I could enjoy games like many people around me do, just not care what happens, not care if it makes sense. But I restart from the beginning because I want my playthrough to make as much sense as possible. I've seen people obsess over achievements or not getting spotted or doing every quest and collecting everything that can be collected. That's not my case. As a game designer as well, I know that games aren't meant to be 100%ed, that mistakes are learning experiences and are meant to be had.

So I plan out the perfect run, with perfect actions, with an expectation that a certain NPC will behave a certain way (which they sometimes don't), with perfect mistakes too. It's obsessive-compulsive but I can explain it: I want the game to make sense, as a story that can be told, that gradually reveals itself and.. Well I don't know, makes as much sense as possible. I can't explain what that means but I can explain what it's not.

NPCs doing a randomly-picked idle that isn't the best for the occasion story-wise doesn't make sense. Revealing too much of the mechanics or item variety right from the get go doesn't make sense. Glitches obviously don't make sense, as don't things that don't tell the story I want to tell.

So that's what I do: I try to tell the best story that can be told in the context of the game. Not the perfect story, but a perfectly imperfect one. And it's the reason why I couldn't get past Skyrim's intro for two weeks now. I've completed the game before, mind you, I know it like the back of my hand. But I just want that perfect story and I won't leave till I get it.  
   
 Edit: I don't seem to get that feeling in either games that cannot be restarted at all, like TF2 or CSGO (linked to steam profile), or in games that are very well designed so that everything you do makes sense, like Half-life.",24,/r/gaming/comments/fwi0px/help_wanted_i_keep_restarting_games_to_get_it/

g0bhiu,gaming,Are there any legit Super NES emulators out there for PC?,"DISCLAIMER: I'm not very knowledgeable about this kind of thing, If I use wrong words, or say something (or this whole post) sounds dumb it comes from me not knowing what I'm talking about. I do own a SNES and all of the games mentioned below, however they're in another state, and with the Virus and lockdowns inplace I'm unable to procure them at this time. The last thing I need to mention is when I posted this initially, I was at work, and was unable to google anything or find information about what I was asking due to time restraints.  With this out of the way....

So I was thinking while I was stuck in a position at work. Does steam, or any other launcher have any Super NES games available for purchase? And i mean ported over to PC like a lot of other games I've seen. I'm fairly sure I saw some type of Capcom game played on a PC before (could have been a ROM(?) though.

I was looking back fondly playing super mario world, Top Gear II, Madden 98', DK  Country, ect when I was little, And was hoping that maybe there would be a sliver of hope to be able to play these games again on PC. I'm more than happy to pay for the actual games if they do in fact exist. 

If not well I'll maybe be able to retrieve my old SNES system from my parents house in another state sometime in the future.

Also if you know any legit sources where I could get these games to play on PC I would appreciate it!

Edit: emulator wasn't the right word to use. My apologies. I'll fix this as soon as I'm home.

So with being partially furloughed at work and only so much to do, I decided to pull out my roommate’s Xbox 360. It belonged to an ex and the game selection seemed not so great. 

The one that caught my eye was Skyrim. I had no idea what it was about (or what I was getting into) when I popped it in to play. 

Fast forward to a week later and I am HOOKED! OMG, i feel like it was a great decision going into the game blindly. At first I was like ok this is kinda blah. And I’ve had to look online for a little help and made it a week (level 7, almost 8) playing at the Adept level (didn’t know I could change the difficulty level 😂😂😂) 

This game is amazing though. The attention to detail and the depth of all the towns, etc. I’ve got like 5 quests going at once but was relieved when I discovered I could go toggle them off/on when actively playing a specific one. 

Anyways yeah! Just wanted to share this excitement from a first time gamer!1",24,/r/gaming/comments/g10d9n/first_time_gamer_playing_skyrim/

g44d5h,gaming,Looking for videogames featuring museums,"Hi everyone,

As an avid gamer, historian and museum educator, I am planning to write a series of articles on how videogames have made use of museums. Do they simply replicate the physicality of museums, do they reinvent the transfer of knowledge by virtual means? Are there virtual innovations which could translate to analogue museums?   


In order to conduct my research I am looking for videogames which use museums as a part of their experience. In example; Animal Crossing, Assassin's Creed, BioShock, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, The Stanley Parable and Uncharted 3. 

I was wondering if this community might have some suggestions on videogames which feature museums. 

Looking forward to your responses, thanks in advance!",24,/r/gaming/comments/g44d5h/looking_for_videogames_featuring_museums/

It's my first time playing it, and the game is pretty damn entertaining for a JRPG. In terms of design, it actually resembles Mass Effect in a lot of ways (think several ""worlds"", three characters who play at once, tons of different endings). Now, imagine Chrono Trigger as a 3rd-person rpg: it would essentially be a platform-like Mass Effect with more melee combat, fun combo techniques, and a great story. Pressure the original developers from BioWare together and make this happen, people.

One day Microsoft or Obsidians upper management will change and that may or may not be the start of their downfall. As for CDPR, they're currently a great company, but that can change in time.

fuvdzd,gaming,[Discussion] We have reached a peak in gaming with the PS4. Next gen will only offer better graphics and that's all. Am I wrong?,"I don't think that the next generation of consoles will bring us any new features we didn't already have. What change between PS3 and PS4? I think only graphics improved. We got bigger maps and we got more objects at run time. So a game like Assassin's Creed Unity was possible with many NPCs walking around on the streets of Paris - THAT is the only change I can think of between PS3 and PS4 IF we ignore VR. Faster loading times and nicer graphics will make things nicer but it won't change game play or anything. 

So I actually believe that almost anything could get ported to the Switch if it hasn't too many object at run time or they heavily reduce the objects. 

Basically I feel like we have reached a peak with PS4 Pro that can only be topped in graphics quality. 

Am I wrong here? How do you feel about this? What need game play changes or what not could suddenly be possible with better hardware besides VR?

fx3atf,gaming,"Bought a new PC after 12 years, suggest me games","So I decided to buy a proper PC after a long break from gaming (just once in a while playing old classics). The ""newest"" PC game I've played is Skyrim, so that gives a little bit perspective. I am anxiously waiting for my packet to arrive, so meanwhile i'd be happy to hear about your suggestions. I also have Oculus Quest so you can suggest PC games or VR games.

I have already been suggested:

1. The Witcher 3
2. Red Dead Redemption 2
3. Far Cry 5
4. Half Life Alyx (this is absolutely the first game I'm gonna try)
5. Mount&amp;Blade Bannerlord
6. Cyberpunk 2077 (when it's released)
7. Skyrim VR

This is the gear I have ordered:

1. Processor: AMD Ryzen 9 3900X, 3.8/4.6 GHz
2. Motherboard: ASUS AMD X570 
3. Graphics card: ASUS NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Super, 8GB GDDR6
4. Main memory: 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4 3200MHz
5. Mass storage: 500GB M.2 NVMe SSD + SeaGate Barracuda 1TB
6. Cooler: Noctua NH U12S

This is my first post here and I was wondering if you all could help me out a little bit. I am stuck in my house currently due to being at high risk of COVID and have honestly been super bored and haven't found any games that have really captured my attention lately. You can only play so much Call of Duty, Rocket League, 2k, etc. before they get bland or you run out of friends that are on at the time. What games do you guys suggest I give a look at? I have both an Xbox One (with game pass ultimate) and a pretty decent gaming PC that can run basically all games. This game can be a story driven single player game or a super addicting multiplayer game, I love them all. Have been gaming my whole life and am looking for the next game that engulfs my life since I have nothing better to do during this quarantine.

On top of this I was also not liking that its only half a game, and that you have to buy the other half of the remake years from now when it comes out. And no I dont think them ""filling the game with sidequests and additional content"" serves as a good excuse to split the main story into two different games.

g7jomy,gaming,What are some good games for older people to play?,"Hey all,

My father recently bought an Xbox One and currently only has one game Ghost Recon: Wildlands. He got his console back in November and he says his character cannot get any further without playing online which he doesn't really want to do.  He has never really been a big gaming person so it's his only real venture into the gaming world. I was hoping to get him another game but I am not sure what a good game to get him is since he is new to gaming. I was thinking about getting something like Overcooked so him and my mother could play together but it seems pretty cartoony and I don't know if they would like that.  So I am a bit stuck.

Can anyone recommend any easy to moderate games on the Xbox one in the single player/offline multiplayer genre?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!


Edit:
Thanks for all the help everyone!  I think I'm going to get them Batman, Red Dead Redemption, and either Portal or Overcooked and see how they react to those games.
Thanks again!",23,/r/gaming/comments/g7jomy/what_are_some_good_games_for_older_people_to_play/

fttxtv,gaming,What Are The Best Games in Which You Fight Nazis?,"Hi!

I started replaying The Saboteur recently and recalled how much I love fighting a force that I can see as absolute senseless evil like the Nazis. Wikipedia lists only around 30 games in which you confront the Nazis and I was wondering if there are more or any certain recommendations. So far I've played:

* The Saboteur
* Wolfenstein 3D
* Return to Castle Wolfenstein 
* Wolfenstein: The New Order
* Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus  

I was planning to play the Sniper Elite series soon and  Wolfenstein: The Old Blood but I would love to know about more games like these. As you can tell, I'm more oriented towards action-shooter games but I'll gladly accept any suggestions!

Thanks ahead.

fyecu0,gaming,How are people not bored to death by repetitively challenging games?,"There are games that are challenging, and then there are games that are repetitively challenging. Meaning there's a roadblock boss/item to the story line and no manner of training, skilling, or grinding will level you up to the point where they are now easier. I'm looking at you Dark Souls, Sekiro, and others like it.

There are other games that will give you a choice whether or not to fight those bosses at that moment even if they are required to beat for the main story. They give you an out if you are feeling overwhelmed. Go kill some other monsters and level up your equipment to make it easier, go build your skill tree and come back when you have the right attributes, go find an ultra-powerful weapon and come back to make this fight more enjoyable. So you do, and you go do some side quests, enjoy yourself in process and come back and voila! The fight is indeed easier - and just as fun because you earned your right to beat that boss by hard work. However, if you REALLY want to challenge yourself the option is still there to try.

I am genuinely curious to those of you who enjoy those types of games, (no shade if you do) what makes it so appealing to work on the same boss for an entire day? A reviewer of Sekiro wrote he put 80 hours into the story. That didn't seem weird until I read that some people were pushing 25-30 hours. 80 HOURS! How long could have been dying and repeating?! That sounds awful to me! Like slamming your head against a brick wall to knock it down instead of just going away for a while and coming back with a sledge hammer like other games allow you to do. How aren't you Soul-like lovers not bored to tears?

g0vopy,gaming,Should I Get A PS4 Or Wait For The PS5? (Long Read),"I told myself if I lose 100lbs I will buy myself a PS4. I currently have a PS3 with a lot of games and I have only clocked one game. 

I use to really enjoy playing my younger bros PS4. I would play multiplayer Call Of Duty 3. I enjoyed it immensely. He cut me off from playing it. However my gaming itch from when I was a child/teen in High school was reignited. 

So I ended up buying a PS3. A lot of things sucked about the PS3. Some games you have to buy a pass code for to play online like Saints Row The Third. Wish I'd have known that before buying it. 

No party chat and less people wanting to talk/games where people talk. Less people online in general, with some games having no one online. It's an older console with not much fanfare or community support. 

Also the multiplayer on COD games are hacked. I almost got the highest level on modern warfare 2 and then some douchebag hackee modded my profile and I gained all the weapons, highest ranking and kept flying in the air. 

This happened twice so I decided to get a different COD Game. Black Ops 2. Now to be fair There was much less hacked lobbies here and I lasted a very long time before I got hacked. Then when my profile got modded again for the third time I was like forget this. 

I haven't played my PS3 in months and months. I plan on getting back into it and maybe just playing story mode games instead of going online. Maybe the reason I got hacked was because I was talking. I really don't know. But it has put me off playing COD on the PS3 and online gaming in general on that system. 

Playing my younger siblings PS4 was really cool. It was the next console that I really played after years off not playing any console. I must have been in my early 20s the last time I played my PS2. Perhaps playing the PS4 before buying my PS3 ruined my PS3 experience. 

I did enjoy COD and Far Cry multiplayer and the little bit of The Last Of Us that I played before my PS3 gaming hiatus. Lol couldn't play The Last Of Us Multiplayer. Did not know how to start it. No one was showing up and I could not get a match, help! Lol. 

My question is. Should I buy a PS4 or just wait for the PS5? 

Yes the PS5 will be more expensive as will the games however there will be so much more to do on their and more people to connect with. However I do really love the PS4 and it will be so much more cheaper pre owned as will the games. 

Thank you for your help 😃. I will post another post asking which of my games I should clock next/which games of mine that you think I should play first to last. Please check it out and give your input if it isn't too much of a hassle.

g1sisr,gaming,Non-gamer trying to buy my first console. Xbox/PlayStation or switch?,"Hey all! I’m having a bit of a predicament- with all of this quarantine stuff going on, I decided it was finally time to buy myself a gaming console but I can’t decide on what to get. 

Backstory - Growing up, my parents never allowed me to get any kind of gaming console other than a Nintendo DS so I’ve never really had a lot of play time with anything other than a DS. A few of my friends growing up had either an Xbox or a PS4, so I’ve played a few games like Call of Duty and Halo here and there, but never anything over a long period of time when I was younger. 

I started dating my boyfriend around a year ago and he bought a used Xbox while we were dating, and I’ve got to say, it’s awesome. I guess my limited experience from my childhood rubbed off on me, as I found that I loovvveeee playing any kind of shooting game and I’ve been obsessed with Apex Legends, Star Wars, etc. The only problem is that I’ve noticed the Xbox seems to have an almost disappointing variety in its selection of games. Either shooting games or Indie games that just don’t seem to excite me all that much. I’ve tried non shooter games with him and only one or two made an impact, the rest just bored me a little. 

Here’s my problem: I was totally set on getting an Xbox before, but since animal crossings came out on the switch I’m so conflicted. That’s pretty much the only game I had on the DS when I was younger and I played it for years. A few people I know have switches and the new animal crossings game and it looks soooo fun. So now I’m thinking about getting a switch because I’m so indecisive;( the only thing holding be back from the switch is the lack of games because it’s so new and the lack of shooting games that I know I love. 

What do you all think? If anyone could give me feedback on one or both of the systems mentioned that would be great! What are your personal opinions about game selections, playability, etc. any ideas of what I should do would be great!",22,/r/gaming/comments/g1sisr/nongamer_trying_to_buy_my_first_console/

g237kr,gaming,Remembering good games: F.E.A.R.,"Before we start, i'm an old game enthusiast, i like new games but the 90s and 2000s are the ones i really love. So, i want to discuss them! I really want to do a lot of posts like this to talk about forgotten good games to remember them.

I think there's no better game to start than F.E.A.R.

For those who don't know it (younger gamers maybe), F.E.A.R. is a horror and action trilogy first launched in 2005, and has one of the most amazing stories, graphics, physics and AI ever made. It's really hard to make a synopsis of this game without spoiling (the story is great), but i found a good concept on wikipedia:  the player takes control of the Point Man, who tries to stop the psychic cannibal Paxton Fettel, who has gained control of supersoldiers created by Armacham Technology Corporation or ATC.

F.E.A.R. also has 2 amazing DLCs; a sequel, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, that is very good too (not so much as the first but an amazing game), more focused on action, with a fascinating story and one of the better endings i've seen in a game; and a ending game on F.E.A.R. 3, an enjoyable game that is 100% action and with a not so good story and a bad conclusion to the series.

Since F.E.A.R. 3 (2011), the series is forgotten, no one talks about that and a new game is not on the plans. Yes, F.E.A.R. 3 ended the main story but there's still possibilities for a new game. F.E.A.R. 1 is on the memories of every gamer that lived in the 2000s, and it's still one of my favorite games. And, since   
there will probably never be a F.E.A.R. 4, let's not forget it.

What's your thoughts on F.E.A.R. series? Which is your favorite game? Ideas for a F.E.A.R. 4? Which games do you like but are forgotten (ideas for other posts)?",22,/r/gaming/comments/g237kr/remembering_good_games_fear/

g3gq2b,gaming,Looking for a challenging/immersive non-hand holdy game.,"Hey everyone. Just as the title says. I recently built a gaming PC. It's my first legit gaming PC ever and not just a passable Dell from WalMart with a GPU shoved in it. I'm itching to do some real gaming during the lockdown. The only problem is every game I try just seems... flat, empty, and characterless. Or it's just... too easy to really engage me.

Since I'm really out of the loop with gaming, I was hoping ya'll could help me out. Maybe there's something on Steam I missed or some less known titles that flew under my radar.

I'm not a graphics snob, but I do like games that look decent and my computer can run DOOM Eternal on Ultra (GTX 1660 and Ryzen 5 2600, 16g of DDR4). I'm looking for something immersive that doesn't hold my hand, has a good story, and is actually challenging to play.

To give an idea of what I'm looking for, here are some of my favorite games and why - 

Starflight - This game was mindblowing (for it's time, it hit Sega Genesis in 1991, I played it years later). You're basically plopped in a space station and told ""All the stars are exploding and we don't know why. Go hunt down clues and figure it out. BTW, we're actually on the clock here - if you don't figure it out in time, game over. Oh, and here's a starship, f you."" There were hundreds of solar systems you had to explore and hunt for clues in, and you had to talk to several distinct alien races, each with their own disposition and agenda with their own little piece of the puzzle. You had a Starmap and a ship. Very open - no quests, nothing on rails, just clue hunting (you literally needed pen and paper to keep track of everything).

Final Fantasy VII - Need I say more? Waiting for the remake to hit PC.

Phantasy Star IV - I didn't play this until like 2006 on an emulator. And you know what? It was still epic even by 2006 standards.

Half Life - One of the best shooters I ever played. Long campaign, decent enough story, many hours sunk into it, puzzles and first person shooting.

Baldur's Gate Series - I played it when it came out and spent many, many long, sleepless nights just trying to figure the effing mechanics out. I stayed up for 3 nights and by the time I fell asleep, I could see the green circles pulsing on my eyelids. No quest markers, no ""?"" or ""!"", lots of puzzles and clue hunting, side quests that spanned many areas, and not to mention an EPIC story. You could choose your path and your choices had real consequences in the game. Huge replayability, easter eggs, challenging encounters, and a campaign that took dozens of hours. Also had a very active modding community. A niche game but the fans were diehard.

Witcher III - Really wish the game didn't have so much hand holding map markers and ""!"" ""?"" icons but otherwise immersive and epic, if a bit repetitive once you figure out the combat formula. Many choices and some consequences to it.

I'm *currently* playing Metro Exodus. Love that there's no out of game map and crafting; you are actually vulnerable when looking at the map. I've only played an hour or two but what I've seen so far is great. No minimap, no quest markers (or minimal waypoints on your little crappy map), no hand holding, limited resources.

Thanks everyone and hopefully I'm not breaking any rules.",22,/r/gaming/comments/g3gq2b/looking_for_a_challengingimmersive_nonhand_holdy/

I truly and utterly believe that the score of a video game is what brings an epic enhancement to gameplay, immersion and even an emotional level of comprehension that could jerk a tear or two into the eyes of gamers and people alike for whatever reason and it's nothing to be ashamed of.

My favourite, most memorable and impactful score/soundtrack for me is ""Hope"" from ""The Outer Worlds"". Always being a fan of Obsidians work, you can imagine my excitement quickly escalated when I heard that Obsidian and Bathesda would marriage again for another game development.

g8whup,gaming,"Use of “one-shot” term in gaming: just one hit kill, or also “one attempt no death”?","Serious question. I am a native English speaker and professional proofreader. I was talking with my bf who is fluent in English but not native speaking, and he said he told a friend he one-shot a boss in Monster Hunter “I one-shot Nergigante” being the exact sentence, but what he meant by one-shot was “beat without dying”. 

As impressive as his accomplishment was, I have never personally heard one-shot be used this way in my native speaking community. I wanted to see if there is consensus on how the term is used when you say “I one-shot X boss” and if it does also commonly mean “first attempt” or “beat without dying once”. 

To me this seems really confusing to have one term mean multiple possible things like this, especially when it comes to describing achievements. But I am willing to admit I am wrong and want to see if there is consensus here. 

It would rock if I can be directed to appropriate official language resources to check on linguistic consensus. I know there are generally accepted rules about language use in the sub-context of games versus “real life” but want to know how defined these are and where to find reliable source.

fvpghf,gaming,"Help our daughter become a cultured individual: What are some good games to introduce very small children to controller, mouse or keyboard having effects on the screen, and perhaps simple objectives?","Edit 2: Goat Simulator is now installing for her. Not quite sure what that'll mean for her sanity. =p

Edit: We're now looking at Katamari, Rocket League (with idle opponent) and Goat Simulator as likely places to start.

\_\_\_

Our daughter's timeline so far:

* 4 months: Was given my wife's mouse to shoot guns in a Borderlands 2 safe zone. Killed her by mouse wheeling to rocket launcher and pointing at floor.
* 5 months: First frag in FFXV by random button mashing.
* 18 months: Loves asking to have Horizon Zero Dawn booted up so she can press the jump button for 5 minutes straight or perhaps see the woman running.

Daughter just hit 2 years and likes to toy around with a controller while one of us is gaming. **Being responsible,** [cultured](https://i.imgur.com/whlkjVG.jpg) **parents, we want to find simple games that let her toy around with control devices and develop an understanding that it makes things happen on screen.** If there are simple objectives or learning elements (e.g. number awareness), so much the better.

(I personally started gaming a bit before 3 years of age with stuff such as missile command (use mouse to click stuff before it hits - simple controls and objective but a bit too much for her yet) and an arrow keys game about jumping between ice floes. Those games weren't chosen for being well-suited but just by virtue of being available.)

Mobile recommendations are also welcome, but we are particularly looking for PC/console recommendations, since A) We don't want to encourage heavy mobile device use from a young age (children need to play, learn and explore in tons of ways besides gaming - stationary devices are way easier to pace/integrate in a balanced whole). B) In the longer term it lets us co-op game side-by-side and share the games we grew up loving. C) During her childhood we want to minimize her exposure predatory/addicting/ad-spammy games.

**Brainstorm so far:**

\- Lego games: Have a few of those. They are possibly a bit too demanding for the initial learning.

\- Tried Pacman. Turned out to not be ideal because controls only work at junctions so a lot of the button pressing doesn't have feedback.

\- Perhaps Smash Bros. in training mode? Letting her press buttons on different characters with a training dummy? Could work but would love something a bit simpler with an actual objective.

\- Perhaps MAME has some good stuff? Arcade games seem like they could be great for simple objectives and controls with only a few buttons. Perhaps someone knows some chill and simple classics?

\- Perhaps some sort of dress-up game which changes looks/outfits just by clicking or pressing arrow keys (dragging or navigating menus is too complex for a short while yet).

&amp;#x200B;

She's already growing up to enjoy games (and developing well in other areas besides). Please help us find the right games to smooth her learning and exploration of this hobby. =)",21,/r/gaming/comments/fvpghf/help_our_daughter_become_a_cultured_individual/

g1y49a,gaming,"[Serious] I'd like a discussion to find out other gamers views on current games, specifically around on whether or not games deserve second chances, and praise for fixing broken games...","I'd like for us all to put forward opinions on whether or not these games deserve second chances and/or praise as  it's becoming a bit of a trend, this popped into my head with the release of wastelanders for fallout 76. However, fallout is not alone. 

Before I continue I want the community to know that I am primarily an xbox player and so most of my examples are from that platform but please feel free to add more...

So the list of games off the top of my head are.
-Fallout76
-Anthem
-Sea of Thieves
-Rainbow Six Siege
-Gears of War 5
-Breakpoint? (Ubisofts newer title)
-Star Wars Battlefront II
-Battlefield V

It's a small list of the top of my head and most of which I have played (Full disclosure, except breakpoint), I think the list is big enough though that it warrants serious discussion as they are all made by ""AAA"" studios. 

My personal view is that I am sick and tired of these games getting so much praise and gamers falling all over the devs saying ""yeah it's really improved!"" When they spent 10 euro, dollars, whatever, on the game while I payed full wack in all cases, except for gears and anthem of which I bought ultimate editions. Now  yes it is cool that they go to fix these games, but its us day 1 players that played through all the glitches, server disconnections and save progress loss that feel really run down by these games. It does not matter that they fixed it one year or two after launch, I've moved on.

I see this even in myself as I didnt play R6 when it first came out but I've played it within the last year and had a blast, I also went back to star wars battlefront 2 and I had a good time, but there is still a bad taste in my mouth after spending the full amount and it only having the content now.

I really dont know if I am explaining myself well and I do apologise if that is the case, but simply, I am sick and tired of the ""release it now and fix it later"" mentality, because I will no longer to continue to buy new games as I have been shafted too often, and if others feel as I do, and the gaming companies do not see immediate revenue upon release, potentially good games will fail simply because gamers no longer trust the industry to release content packed, WORKING titles.

g3g1d2,gaming,EVICT VILLAGERS OR PREDICT LEAVING REQUESTS IN ANIMAL CROSSING NEW HORIZONS,"[Evidence ](https://m.imgur.com/a/x8n5n6e)that requests to leave happen in 9 day intervals. (Follow link for important gameplay and time stamp pictures)

Exceptions being visits by CJ &amp; KK slider and probably birthdays. They postpone the event but the 9 day pattern continues. When special characters are present you can skip forward another 9 days. 

If you have a full island (10 villagers) then you may occasionally get a campsite visits on a leaving day. 

Characters may be hard to find occasionally but they are there (again with the exception of KK slider/CJ/or birthdays). 

This pattern continues until you accept a request to leave. At that point your timeline is altered and you have to go one day at a time to find a new starting point. Once a character requests to leave you begin the 9 day pattern again. 

You can also return to a date where a character asked to leave multiple times to heighten your chance of a separate villager requesting to leave. However, once you accept a request then all previous leaving dates will change and will no longer have a request available. I will post a picture example of returning to the same day in the comments. 

I recommend traveling after noon but before night to avoid turnip sells or wisp visits. I have not tested either of those characters to see if you get requests during their visits.

ftjd6m,gaming,Do you think the Nintendo Switch is a let down,"I feel like I don’t really have a big library like I have on all my other Nintendo consoles. Part of this is because they release 3rd party games at a ridiculous price. Or I already got them years ago on my Xbox. Or I just don’t want to pay £50 for a game I can get for £10 on my Xbox. Also I had a Wii U and there are a ton of games that got ported but which I already had. Which I felt was Nintendo just trying to make money off them games as the wiiu didn’t sell. Yet it didn’t feel fair to people who had already purchased them and was looking for new games instead of ports. 

Maybe I have just grown out of Nintendo I don’t no. But even the exclusives seem a bit lacklustre. Like we haven’t had a new Mario Kart yet, no Metroid, Star Fox, donkey Kong, F zero seems to be dead. Even series like Wave Race and Diddy Kong Racing seem to be long lost now. It seems to me for a console of 4 years old that the big releases are miles apart. We got Animal Crossing this year. Which to me all those games just feel the same as the last one. 

I feel like it’s gone downhill since the GameCube. Back then 3rd party games were the same price as the other consoles and released at the same time. But now you must wait an extra year and then pay a ton more money. I remember all the resident evil games on GameCube it was something the GameCube had over the other consoles at the time. 

Yes you will come out and say loads have been released. There really are some great games like smash bros, odyssey, Zelda, Luigis mansion, fire emblem. But there isn’t really anything else.

fx1bco,gaming,Am I the only one disappointed with next gen controllers?,"Now that we've seen what Sony and MS are offering in their next gen controllers I feel that they are remarkably disappointing.  The next gen will see the least innovation of input in gaming history.  The last changes that had a real impact are analog triggers on the original Xbox and two thumb sticks on the DualShock at the end of PS1.  It's great that ergonomics are getting better, but what happened to innovation?  

At the very least they could have tossed on a couple back buttons as unique input.  Yes, we haven't seen the back of the DualSense controller, but they would have flaunted those if they were there... anything to have a difference/edge over the competition.  Instead they'd rather sell a new add-on or a new controller that has back buttons, but at that point those couldn't be unique. 

Lack of unique input in my opinion is the most pressing issue.  This has a massive affect on what kinda of game play is possible and what kind of innovations in design we can see.  How many times have you seen someone use the correct button but were in the wrong position, causing them to do the wrong thing?  Like accidentally punching a horse in RDR2.  Devs are trying to give us options but are held back by 20 year old design.  

For those who think changing controllers would make them too complex or too risky, I'd say your mimicking those who said the same in 1990 of the SNES and 1998 of the DualShock.  I'd also say having 6 different functions for a button based on context is more complex.  Increasing depth w/out making it complex is a cornerstone of innovation... difficult but never impossible.",20,/r/gaming/comments/fx1bco/am_i_the_only_one_disappointed_with_next_gen/

g1lh7k,gaming,Diablo 4 is likely to be garbage.,"I'd like to preface this with the fact that I started playing Diablo when I was 4 years old.

Then I played 2 when it came out. I've played the series over 20 years so I know wtf I'm talking about.

The skill tree in 4: the ""perk"" system they called it. It's a very muddled down skill pool it's LITERALLY like dragon age origins. Each character only has a few skills and I know this unless they give it a 100% overhaul that's how it is.

There was NOTHING wrong with the skill tree in 1, especially 2. It was perfected in 2.

In Diablo 3, you put an item on that gives you lets say 200 primary stat (which stats don't even matter in the series anymore which were a STAPLE of the series) it would give you hundreds of thousands of not millions of damage like. That's insane.

It's additive math versus quantitative.
There's a big difference.
You could entirely calculate where your damage is coming from down to the last damage point.

In 3 you can't. I rest my case not should have to say more.

I'm just saying, we had 3 classes in 1, then we had 7 in 2 then just barely got back to that in 3?

Then in 4 they want to give us 3 classes?
NO IDC if it's not even in alpha they said the game will start like that.

g6b83x,gaming,Final Fantasy 7 Remake - Unpopular Impressions," **TLDR:** This game wasn’t my style or what I was expecting. I enjoyed the architecture and environmental aspects. The deviations from the story and the ending didn’t bother me as much as it did others. The combat mechanics were a potent cocktail of rage between the ability interruptions, evasion fails, misses, stun locks, micromanaging, targeting system, and the weapon statistics. The game also felt too linearly enforced; I felt like I was being scolded for trying to explore the world before me by being branded with a yellow warning and forcefully turned around. The game lacked the subtle intricacies the original had. 5/10 for me.

Intro

Just finished the Final Fantasy VII Remake last night. As a long time fan of the Final Fantasy franchise, I have both positive and negative thoughts about this game, though, I certainly do not think FF7R deserves the scores it’s getting, but that’s fine, I respect the opinion of others and understand the gaming industry isn’t what it used to be. I’m seeing other people on here sharing their opinions about the game and getting down voted for anything that isn’t praise, so I'm fully prepared for any negativity.

I played the original Final Fantasy 7 to 100% completion and put several hundred hours into it. I am a long time fan of games Square produced, starting with Super Mario RPG. I gave the original FF7 a 9/10, unfortunately, the remake didn’t come anywhere close to that. Although there were several things I did not like about the remake, overall, I gave FF7R a 5/10 for two primary reasons:

1. Combat mechanics were a mess
2. I felt like I was being scolded for trying to explore

As the tag suggests, this post contains spoilers.

**A Bit of Praise**

Before I dive into those, I want to be clear that I didn’t hate the game, it just wasn’t really my cup of tea or what I was expecting for a game that was in development for as long as it was. Aesthetically, I was impressed with the re-imagined character designs, details in the enemies, the expanded architecture and environment of Midgar, and the music &amp; cinematics associated with the aforementioned. The Train Graveyard and Hojo’s Lab were two of my favorite areas and I loved the designs and differences from the original.

I think I’m one of the few who didn’t mind the story deviations. I thought the expansions on the story, lore, and environments were interesting and entertaining. The ending was a bit of an ass-pull, but I also thought it was creative and certainly piqued my curiosity with what they intend to do with the story next. The ending didn’t bother me as much as I think it did others. I am excited to see how much the story deviates in future releases.

The Not-so-Good Stuff

**1.) Combat Mechanics**

**Ability Interruptions**

* This one actually became quite infuriating several times throughout the game. Your abilities, spells, and item use can be interrupted after you cast it and during mid-execution, and it wastes ATB bars when this occurs. Your limit breakers can be interrupted pre/mid-execution, and it wastes your limit breaker gauge. I could understand maybe if an elite enemy or boss interrupted me if I timed my casting poorly, but no, even a peasant trash mob can cancel out your executions, sometimes mid-execution, by farting in your general direction.
* Limit breakers interruptions in general didn’t make any sense to me. The limit breakers themselves take too long to build up and it’s considered to be their ultimate move. The very first time I had the opportunity to use a limit breaker was against a dog-like enemy and it canceled it out mid-execution as I went flying to the ground. I thought maybe this was a bug, but then it happened more and more as I continued playing. Limit breakers should not be subject to interruptions just like summons are not.

**Not-Evade**

* At first I thought I just sucked with the evade, but as the game progressed, I realized the evade was not an evade at all. An evasive dodge roll to most gamers is reasonably judged through depth perception, trajectory, and timing; these things do not apply here. This became blatantly apparent to me with several enemies (like the dogs or machines) adjusting their trajectory mid-flight as I evaded, only to land on me and do full damage. There were even times enemy attacks visually did not come anywhere close to me following a dodge roll, but I would still take full damage anyway.
* I eventually accepted the evade was not actually an evade, and instead more of a guessing game and/or a gap-closer. I started parrying instead, but even then, some enemies &amp; moves cannot be parried, and sometimes parrying isn’t the best option depending on the fight or number of enemies.
* I also noticed Cloud was an acrobatic super ninja in the cinematics, and there was even one particular battle with Sephiroth where he was performing the equivalent of “blink” as he visually disappeared from view while trying to juke the shit out of him. If Cloud cannot do this during my combat experience, don’t tease me with his pseudo-powers in cinematics.

**Miss!**

* There were several times I used any of Cloud’s abilities, only to have the enemy casually meander to the left as I observed Cloud completely whiff like an amateur Rocket League player, what a save! There were times I used Barrett's overcharge ability while facing an enemy, only to have him turn around to face the camera and shoot at nothing, wasting the move entirely. I used Rise and Fall while facing an enemy, while Tifa continued to kung pow chicken open air as her enemy cha-chas past her. Ray of Judgement was a sweet move to use, when the enemy didn’t take a single step in any direction and leave Aerith laser beaming the shit out of nothing. Even the AI got a piece of this action when Red XIII tried to front flip power bomb a trash mob and completely soared past it into the wall.
* But the most infuriating of them all occurred during countless limit breakers with Cloud and Tifa. The first time it happened, my jaw dropped as I watched Cloud violently, passionately, swing his fucking heart out as if it were some tribute to the OG star wars kid.

**Stun Locks**

* This wasn’t as frequent of a problem during trash mob fights, but became a bit ridiculous later on in the game. The multi-electro-whack-a-mole simulator in Hojo’s lab was an elaborate display of lightning and “Stop” spells, and imagine my surprise when the enemies could hit you while inflicted with Stop. I party wiped twice here before I changed some equipment to stop it from happening.
* I don’t know if this was just bad luck, but during my fight with Whisper Rubrum, Whisper Viridi and Whisper Croceo, they played hot potato with Cloud’s body for a solid 30 seconds. Wasted a lot of ATB bars keeping members healed during this fight and was surprised I didn’t have to redo it.

**Aerial Enemies**

* I grew irritated with any exclusive air-only enemy where I didn’t have a ranged ally, especially when Cloud and/or Cloud &amp; Tifa were in a party. Unless I’m missing something, I didn’t find a way to use any abilities to attack air enemies, which meant either you button mash basic attacks until they’re dead or adhere to the forced-weakness systems by equipping your characters with fire, ice, lightning, or wind materias before hand. Since I had no idea what was running into, I eventually resorted to having wind and lightning materia on someone at all times, but I would’ve preferred not to as materia slots are limited as it is. This is probably more of a me problem, but I felt like materia use was more forced than it should’ve been. Most fights with aerial enemies involving close range characters just felt like a chore to me.

**Targeting**

* I lost count how many times I wanted one of my characters to focus on the enemy directly in front of me, only to have them focus on the enemy 50 yards away and start punching or swinging at the air violently while the enemy right next to them stood in awe at their opponent’s lack of awareness. The clunky targeting system for basic attacks rarely worked in my favor.

**Micro-manager**

* What were my allies doing in fights? I felt like I spent more time trying to micro-manage ATB gauges and adjusting positions than I was trying to strategically battle my opponent. I would’ve loved to see some kind of option to set default behavior of an ally I’m not actively controlling.
* Personally, I would’ve loved to control Tifa most of the time in battles; she was a monster and I found myself leading battles with her whenever she was in my party. The feel of the momentum of her combat was so addicting that I realized I was growing annoyed with having to step out of that zone every few seconds to baby sit ATB gauges and re-position Aerith, who constantly behaved like that noob-mage/healer in your party that thinks she’s a tank and stands in red circles.

**Weapon System**

* I loved the idea of weapon skill trees and mastery of skills, but I found myself ignoring most of the weapons and the skills in them. I was especially disappointed in their “end game” weapons. For example, Cloud’s Hard Edge, which I obtained in Chapter 9, was more physically powerful than every subsequent weapon, including Twin Stinger obtained in Chapter 17. Tifa’s Metal Knuckles, which you get in Chapter 5, are physically stronger than any of her other gloves. Barret’s Big Bertha is physically stronger than the EKG cannon. Yes, I’m aware, some of them have stronger magic attack power for different builds and play styles. Call me crazy here, I just felt like a dude carrying a big-ass sword, a dude with a massive gun arm, and a girl who punches and kicks like a Tekken grandmaster should adhere to a physical-attack combat scheme. Different strokes for different folks I guess.

**2.) Forced Linear progression**

The little yellow warning that spams on your character when you try to deviate from the beaten path feels like a scolding for wanting to explore the world in all its glory. I thought this game was beautiful and given the amount of time it took to develop in combination with what I experienced in the original, I expected there to be a myriad of hidden paths to take, goodies, and plenty of freedom to explore the world they created. Granted, in the original, Midgar was mostly linear, but it wasn’t *forced linear*, that is, I wasn't forcefully turned around when I didn’t go exactly where I was supposed to go. The remake took a different turn and enforced specific paths, painful interactive cut scenes, and arbitrary interactions.

**Where’s the hidden goodies?**

I was really surprised by the lack of intricacies and hidden secrets &amp; treasures.

Remember in the Subway in the original how you could explore the winding path and find a w-item materia? What about the goody behind Corneo’s bed? Or the air ventilation system mini-puzzle in the Shinra building leading to different rooms and trading the Coupon C for the All materia?

Closing thoughts

Perhaps I just have too high of expectations, but the remake just didn’t do the original game much justice. Sure, the story is great in both games, but I felt like FF7R focused entirely too much on cinematics and graphics rather than constructing a sense of adventure through subtle details from the original that helped make it into the masterpiece it was. FF7R is a forced linear, story driven game. That’s ok for some people, but it isn’t my style. Maybe because I’m getting older my taste in games is skewed to the classic experiences. I played through all of the Final Fantasy games, some of the classics like Super Mario RPG, Secret of Mana, Secret of Evermore, the Zelda games, etc, but I also feel like some studios are nailing a good balance between the elements with more recent games too: The new God of War, Horizon, FF15, Breath of the Wild, for example.

Overall I think the remake took away too much of what made the original what it was, hence why it's a *remake*. I felt like the original helped set a standard for RPGs. I was bummed about the outcome and was looking for more of a similar feel that FF15 presented with its gameplay. Again, perhaps my brain is skewed a bit from my childhood, but I was really hoping the remake would do that memory some justice. I didn't think I was the only person who felt this way. I guess we'll see.

fsv6ss,gaming,/played - 130+ days,"Hey guys,

First off, I hope everyone is doing well and staying healthy. During these trying times, some of the people around me have been sharing how dreadful it is to stay indoors for extended periods of time due to quarantine. I for one have never had an issue as games have always been a part of my life. One game in particular that comes to mind is World of Warcraft.

I got into WoW in 2006 and I became part of a great guild that did level 60 end-game raids. Ah, those 40 man raids lol 40 people jammed into a Ventrilo server, working like a well-oiled machine to bring down some raid bosses. Everyone had a role and contribution to the guild and it created a huge sense of community and belonging; one of the reasons I played for so long. Anyway, after Burning crusade launched, and with it the introduction of Arenas, I was hooked on PvP. I want to say BC is where I peaked in terms of WoW expertise. I reached 2200+ arena ranking on my main (Night Elf Druid) and I stuck to her ever since. As for later expansions, I always found myself hitting the max level but never played as hardcore as Burning Crusade. Every once in a while I'll still get on for a taste of those battlegrounds.

Today, I felt like checking my honorable kills and game-time (/played) for my Druid. This really got me thinking and I'd like to ask the community a general question:

What is your highest game-time title and what did you enjoy the most about it? :)

Cheers!

fsw1mu,gaming,A real fantasy becomes reality.,"**TLDR**: Old game gets new graphics, surpasses fantasy childhood wish.  Old man appreciates games. Don't spoil your kids.  


Now firstly I'll admit this was something I wanted with a somewhat obscure game released in the dying throws of a console being over looked by time in Sega's Panzer Dragoon Saga. I remember it vividly as after a hiatus from NES to the dawn of the Dreamcast era. I only got to sporadically play games when visiting friends. But one day my dad got me a Saturn on the cheap. It just so happened to be the month before Sega Saturn Magazine would drop the entire first disc on Panzer Dragoon Saga as its demo disc.  While Virtua Fighter and Sega Rally werre fun. it's only when I played this games hooked me in. The FMV's were just gorgeous, and the graphics while blocky left much to be desired.   


A while later a school friend who had recently moved a good distance away invited me over for a weekend, with a plan to play Final Fantasy VII. I didn't have a playstation, I was lucky to even have my saturn and a handful of pre-owned games. But there was a goal set to just do it in a weekend. No internet, not guides, (and what would turn out to be a scratched to unplayable second disc).  


With FF7 being the it game of its original time, my friends had basically given me cart blanche to nuke it out. Long story short we borrowed another friends 2nd disc for the weekend when we figured it out, and powered through in about 42 hours of in game time.  


But I'll always remember loving the FMV's. we were awed, we laughed, we cried out in horror and despair. 'It's just a shame it's so blocky' 'I wish one day we could play games that looked as good as these FMV's.'   


Now while it didn't take 23 years for that wish to be surpassed. A series of events and decisions has lead up to this point where officially, in 9 days as of writing. Final Fantasy VII at least in part has been remade and has far surpassed even the PS3 tech demo level of graphics. Let alone a teenage fantasy of playing games of FMV quality from 1996/1997.  


I scrutinised the hell out of that poor FF7 demo. But not long after Resi 3 dropped its demo and my word its like my teenage years have come back in full force. If you are below a certain age, there is just a instant meme of 'what we thought the game looked like vs. what it actually looked like.' simply because our imagination filled in the gaps. I'm sure there are plenty of examples for games of today even, but not one, but two games are coming in the coming days I remember so fondly and vividly that have been recreated and rebuilt from the ground up, that Entire new generations of gamers are going to get to experience for the first time ever.   


Some kids are going to be playing these games and if you have a parent  who used to play games but is far to busy or distracted are going to find them talking to you about these games in a detective pikachu 'did you just understand me?' level. Sadly for FF7 I'm hoping to the genuinely blind that you aren't spoiled by said parent by accident.

I play Pubg so some freezes/crashes are expected.

-1 case of looking in inventory and icons for items missing.
This results in background sounds go missing for a few seconds, until the game freezes a few seconds and comes back.

-At least 5 cases of just the background noise going silent 5-10 seconds on its own.

-1 or 2 cases of the entire game going silent (no footstep sounds 😬)

-Game freezing 2-10 seconds while audio stutters.

-1 freeze more than 10 seconds, mostly resulting in game crashing. But do sometimes come back.

But how are all of these affecting how I view it through my 4k TV, because the size of the screen never changes. Does it just affect the density of pixels, and therefore the sharpness?

Would a 1080p resolution set to full screen on a 4k TV look worse, but perform better than a 1440p on full screen on the same TV? And the smaller windowed mode you use make it sharper again?

ftrcj9,gaming,Older gamer talks about joy of gaming!,"Hey everybody, 

I'm 46 years old, from Croatia, I fell in love with gaming when I saw Commodore 64 computer that my neighbour bought in 1986. From this day on I always loved gaming. But at one point in life I got stuck in marriage with a kid, and my wife didnt want me to play  the games, it was like a worse thing that you could do, so I had to push it way down on list of my priorities. So 8 years later I got divorced, and started living single, and I basicaly rediscovered my joy of playing games, and that was point i installed Steam and started to see all the benefits from buying games (before that I was playing mostly pirated games, Eastern Europe....). But at this point of life money was not the problem, and I wanted to have all the benefits you get from original games that you buy. So, fast forward few years, I am back in marriage, the 2nd one, but this time my wife can see that there are benefits from gaming for her also. If I had my daily dose of playing games, I will help her around the household, and do all the chores, and have a quality time with her, and everybody is so much better if everybody gets what they need and what they enjoy on daily basis. But I am not here to preach about that. 

I wanted to talk a little about a way I choose the next game I will play. At one point I had 170 games on Steam, and nothing to play.  I think that everybody knows that feeling. So, finally, I found a way how to choose a next game. Chronological order. Oldest games a first to be played. And when this came to my mind I was like, WOW, it was staring at me all the time and I didnt see it. So I went through my complete Steam inventory, and wrotte down year the game was released. And just started playing from the oldest to the new game. I started with Farcry 1 (2003), then Witcher 1 (2008), Farcry 2 (2008), Mass Effect (2008), S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky (2008), Warhammer 40K Dawn of War II (2009), and next game will be Star Ruler, released in 2010, and so on. I finally have order in my life. Both in marriage and in gaming. I just had to share this with you guys, maybe someone will find this useful or funny in some way....

fu2748,gaming,Does anybody know of any roadmap as to Rockstar fixing Red Dead Online?,"Okay, I like Red Dead Online but it’s seriously broken, and not just bugs here and there I mean like it’s completely downright broken on a daily basis. 

Is Rockstar going to fix their game or are they too concerned about milking more money out of GTA online that they are neglecting Red Dead? 

If anybody knows this I’d like to know because I really want this game to be a good experience but quite frankly it’s absolutely horrible sometimes. 

I got a list of bugs I run into on a daily basis. 

1, The camp spawns down in New Austin when I had it in the Heartlands before. 

2, The camp won’t move when I try to relocate it back to heartlands. 

3, Camp won’t repitch when it disappears after attempting to relocate it.

4, Camp pitches but when I go to it, nothing is there except sometimes just Cripps walking around. 

5, I often cannot interact with bounty posters.

6, Attempting to start a trader delivery many times results in a never ending black loading screen. 

7, I’ve encountered several times when NPC’s won’t die and just stand around preventing me from being able to do bounties and so on. 

8, going from free roam to PVP or vice versa often results in my guns being unclean even though I just wasted gun oil to clean them. 

9, eating food and then going into PVP or vice versa often results in my stats being back down to where they where before I ate despite just eating food. 

10, moonshine shack sometimes disappears when loading into a game. 

11, when I was able to load into a trader delivery, if I got to the end, it wouldn’t load to give me my money or it would infinitely load back into freeroam. 

12, the most common is disconnecting after completing missions, bounties or right as I try to go into freeroam. 

These are the most common and most gamebreaking bugs I’ve encountered often times on a daily basis.",2,/r/gaming/comments/fu2748/does_anybody_know_of_any_roadmap_as_to_rockstar/

So, Xbox one X on a 48’ 3D Samsung (I like 3D) from 2014. It’s just HD rather than 4K as I don’t have the scratch to upgrade and this is still a damn good tv. 

I’ve got things looking as crisp and as smooth as I can but there’s a strange smudge that is generated around the edges when I quickly move the camera around. It’s worse on some games like on RDR2 it’s an nuisance but it’s glaringly obvious and slightly nauseating  on Skyrim. 

I can turn on game mode which fixes it but then the overall visual quality drops and, for some reason, the sound becomes massively muted forcing me to crank the volume.

fwyzpt,gaming,Small glitch in Animal crossing new horizons that lets you complete one of the nook miles goals faster,"Not sure if this has been posted here before, but I searched around both here and on google and couldnt find anything, so Im not sure if this bug has even been discovered yet.

Anyway, this is regarding the ""island togetherness"" task in the nook miles app. To earn the miles on this one, you have to talk to every one of your villagers in the same day. You earn miles for doing this for 1, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days. 

The bug is that if you complete this task on a given date, then the clock moves to another date (either naturally or via changing the system clock) and then you time-travel BACK to the date you did this on, it counts it towards the goal AGAIN.

So for example, if you talk to every one of your villagers on the 6th, thatll count as one. Talk to all of them again on the 7th, thatll be two. Then time travel back to the 6th, and itll count it as number 3. Time travel back to the 7th, and itll say youve talked to everyone 4 times, etc. Or if you talk to everyone on the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, thatll be 4 so far, and then time traveling to any of those days will increase the counter by 1.

I havent check if this affects any other nook miles goals yet, but Ive confirmed for certain it works for the ""Island togetherness"" goal.

If this bug is already well know, I apologize. I searched around and couldnt find anything about it, so I thought it was worth posting.",2,/r/gaming/comments/fwyzpt/small_glitch_in_animal_crossing_new_horizons_that/

fy0edh,gaming,Final fantasy 7 remake - First impressions (no spoilers),"First of all, if you are not familiar with final fantasy don’t be intimidated by the 7.
Every part of final fantasy was a game for its own and those are not real sequels with an overall storyline.

So if you enjoy JRPGs with an amazing soundtrack, great battles and a great story FF7 is for you :)

My first impressions after a few hours from the remake as someone who loved the original... wow, i really like it!
The turn based battle stuff in the original wasn’t exactly my favorite cup of tea but it got the job done.
So the battle system of the remake is more to my liking.

The small and big changes how stuff plays out storywise don’t kill anything from the original. It’s enhanced. 
Playing with a 5.1 surround system... sound design is great and the small nuances in the soundtrack are well placed (hints of you know who hehe)
I also a fan of pre rendered cut scenes and those are nearly seamless implemented here. Good job.

I hope they keep the high level until the end of this episode. But i am already sad that we have to wait years for the next part or it tanks and never gets finished.

fygr0l,gaming,Come try this forgotten gem,"I want to make a shameless plug for my favorite game of all time, Clan Lord. This is one of the original MMORPGs. It came out before WoW! It has mouse-driven movement and an in-game chat system, with a fantasy setting. When you start out, you pick your character, whether fighter, healer, or mystic. There are different races to choose from and you can personalize your avatar. There is no PvP, so the other players can't hurt you. (Except in one designated area so people can test their strength against each other!) You can focus more on socializing and role-playing, or you can work on hunting and leveling up your character. Most of us do a bit of both. You can also spend your time exploring and solving puzzles, or learning a craft to create and sell items to other players for in-game coins.

Since it's been around for so long, there is a TON of content to explore. You could spend years getting lost in this world and finding fun little secrets. There are puzzles to solve and hidden areas to discover. There's even a crazy guy that lives in a hut in the marsh! It would be \*really\* fun to join up with a group of friends so that you're all starting out on the same level.

We've had some new players join, and some of us have gotten our kids into it too. There's not a bunch of swearing and immature behavior. It's a great community and it's good typing practice for the kids!  They learn teamwork, cooperation, and manners while playing with each other. 

There is a free demo, and if you like it, it's a low flat fee instead of a monthly charge. I am telling you, this game will keep you (and your kids!) entertained for HOURS while we all stay home and stay safe.

There has been a resurgence of previous players since the pandemic started, so if you played Clan Lord in the past, come log on again- your characters are still there.

fyjbhn,gaming,I have some worries about Watch Dogs Legion...,"The reason the game keeps getting delayed is, you can play as or recurit any NPC. That's the main gimmick and feature of the game, and it's a big technical problem/task for the development team. They're struggling to get it right for multiple reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

 For one, they won't be able to design and voice every and each character in the game to be completely unique. There will almost definitely be NPCs (I guess not technically NPCs but you get it) that will look like identical twins, wear the same outfits, have the same backstory, and have the same voice.

&amp;#x200B;

 This will be a problem, when you are exploring the open world of London you'll begin to notice NPCs that look alike. You'll hear the same voices and dialogue every few minutes or so.

&amp;#x200B;

 When you read people's profiles many of them will seem quite similar, you'll find quite a few ex-spies, hackers, and such. Many will seem like they're just copy and paste.

&amp;#x200B;

 Playing as any NPC will get old when about half of them will be pretty much just twins. Then there's the problem of being able to play as or recurit an enemy that's attacking you or someone who's necessary for the campaign and story.

&amp;#x200B;

 They won't be able to figure it out, they don't know how to make it so you can play as any NPC even ones that are necessary to the campaign, how can you progress the story if you can play as anyone... They are having a hard time I bet you, trying to figure out how the missions and progression as well as the entire story of the game will actually work. 

&amp;#x200B;

 How are you going to progress in the story and campaign if you are just able to switch and play as a character that's important to the story? That's a nightmare for developers, it's a never ending rabbit hole, to have to create everyone in the game unique and every person has to be able to fit into the story and progression somehow as well as be playable. It's going to be a mess. And it makes you wonder why they choose this feature to begin with.

&amp;#x200B;

 Every open world game ever released, has duplicate NPCs, you'll go down the street and see at least two of the same person most times more than that. This will hinder the games main feature. It's cool to play as anyone until you realize you've played as this person already a couple times but this time they just have a different name and slightly different backstory... 

&amp;#x200B;

 You're able to play as anyone, whether they're an enemy, boss, or story character, you can play as them and because of that you'll find many duplicate NPCs and the story and campaign progression will be an absolute mess if not broken. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Plus you'll play the game and notice that every single person even the elderly are able to fight and do all these crazy things, there won't be any handicapped and such, even people that look like they couldn't run two steps or put two and two together they will be able to do kick flips and hack into things... It'll be ridiculous unless you like the goofiness of that. Not to mention every ""NPC"" will play and feel quite the same if not exact the same. They won't have individual unique controls for each character.

&amp;#x200B;

 Sadly this is why the game won't work as people are expecting. They aren't going to be able to create each character in the game as a unique character with their own voice and backstory. And they won't be able to figure out the campaign progression if players can just keep switching characters and play as someone who is important to the story. It just won't work. 

&amp;#x200B;

 It's not going to be like people think, where you can just run over and shoot a character and that NPC is gone forever and you can't play as them anymore, no you'll eventually see another one just like them and get another chance to play as or recurit them.

&amp;#x200B;

 I mean it'll pretty much be like this ""Oh look I can play as anyone and I can play as their twin and their twins twin too! Oh look this enemy is attacking me I'll just switch and play as him now. Hey this character just gave me a mission, so I'm just going to switch and play as them instead.""

&amp;#x200B;

 If there's a main protagonist who's the main enemy of the game, or if there's a person who gives you an important mission, you can just play as them and completely change the entire story of the game, and that is why the game won't work.

&amp;#x200B;

fykvkk,gaming,"Seasons, battle passes, and constant limited time content has made me give up playing more games than it's ever enticed me to play.","I've completely stopped playing multiple games I used to enjoy (Destiny 2 and Division 2 are a couple of examples) because they all have a pressure to play them nonstop and it feels like clocking in to make sure you get your levels, collectibles, whatever by playing the game in a way that is probably not how you'd like to be spending your time playing it. And I get that mostly it's cosmetic stuff in the passes and whatnot, but using the Destiny 2 example, there are parts of the story and the world building you just miss if you don't take part in a certain weeks event to unlock the next event, encounter, so on. So if you want to pick back up later you have to go do some homework to know what's even happening since you didn't take part in the previous events. 

I have a lot of time to play games but I barely even have time to do that for one game let alone every other game that has that expectation. It was fine when it was a tacked on thing for loot and cosmetics but now they're the main source of gameplay in some instances. I've gotten to the point where I sit down to play games and think about how I don't want to mess with any of them because I feel the pressure to do whatever event is happening (sometimes because it's copied over the things I would normally do anyways) and it feels like I came home from work to work on something else!

The only good to come out of it is I'm just not playing games as much and going to do other more productive things and playing some great single player stuff that I never felt like I had time for before. So I guess in some small part thanks game companies for making me stop playing games as my main hobby after 20+ years of it?",2,/r/gaming/comments/fykvkk/seasons_battle_passes_and_constant_limited_time/

fz6taz,gaming,Best Year and Console for MLB Slugfest?,"Been talking with my friends from childhood a lot lately about the hours and hours we spent playing sports games on the PS2 and GameCube.  Literally sit inside for days on end playing sometimes in the summer.  So naturally, the quarantine has us reminiscing about Madden franchises with fantasy draft (drafted every round, every time) where we played to the end of possible years you could play (more than once lol) or close, while playing each other twice a year plus playoffs.  And manually doing every single owner/coach task.  Still remember some of our stud player names.  

Playing Tiger Woods on my friends GameCube, where the guest controller had gotten into a fight with his dog and not only had not rubber padding, it had a sharp edge.  But it made winning that much sweeter when you did it with a cut up finger and a janky controller.  

I could go on and on (and have all week with my pals).  But the reason I am making this post is during our talks, we discussed some sports games we never got a chance to play.  Or do not have a copy anymore and are wondering what to buy it on and what version.  So I am making this post to ask a few questions, and I am hoping some of you folks can point us to the right games!  : ).  


1. MLB Slugfest - NFL Blitz but...MLB.
     - What year/version is the best? 
     - What console(s) were the best or worst?
     - Can you get it digitally or in a collection on      any more modern console?


2.  NHL Hitz - NFL Blitz but.. NHL.
     - What year/version is the best? 
     - What console(s) were the best or worst?
     - Can you get it digitally or in a collection on      any more modern console?


3. Suggestions for a more modern golf game similar to Tiger Woods 2001/2/3.  
     - realistic but some opponents were pretty goofy cartoons which we loved.  And some courses were real while others were more fantastical.  
     - joy stick swinging and putting (although it changed in either 02 or 03) were not too hard but very fun. 
     - enjoyed playing skins as the story mode to unlock characters and courses.  Plus the rpg element of leveling up.  And skins versus each other. 


4.  Any new good NBA jam or a spiritual successor?  The one for x360 was decent from the arcade/store.  But all I see now is the free to play NBA Playgrounds with a million microtransactions which really turns me off.  Not even sure if it compares or is any good.  


5.  Any decent newer games that are similar or a spiritual successor to NBA or NFL street?  Or even just And1 style streetball?


6.  We all loved NFL Blitz and 2000.  I enjoyed Blitz: The League.  It wasn't the best but got my money's worth.  Is Blitz The League 2 worth picking up still?  How has it held up?  


7.  Missed out on all the GameCube Mario sports games.  What are the best or must haves that still hold up?  Prefer it to have a decent single player circuit / story.  


8.   At this point you know have an idea of what we are looking for.  Any suggestions outside the above are welcome!  If we can get them on modern consoles, great, and local coop even better!  (Online play would be sweet too but hard to match up our hours).  



Have pretty much every main console since N64 besides PS1 and Dreamcast and most handhelds, so just focus on the best system or at least what system was terrible so we avoid it.


Our plan is to pickup some of these games and play seperate while video chatting to ward off the quarantine blues by playing games we never got to but always wanted to.  Plus maybe some remakes or modern takes on the ones we loved.  While at the same time, introducing them to our loved ones at home so they can make some new memories.  


Thanks so much for your help!  Stay safe and sane out there!",2,/r/gaming/comments/fz6taz/best_year_and_console_for_mlb_slugfest/

fzc8ff,gaming,[QUESTION] One change that I think would greatly improve PUBG game play ... does WARZONE do this?,"I've been playing PUBG for a while and I really enjoy it.  However, I think a major problem that if another player spots you, he shoots and kills you in a fraction of a second.  This kind of quick-draw sharp-shooting kill is not only unrealistic but it hurts game play.

I think an improvement would be for the targeting sites to start much further apart and to move closer/tighter only after you've attempted to take aim for some moments, maybe a second or two for close range, longer than two seconds for long-range/sniping.

I think adding this element of realism would greatly improve game-play.

fzj5us,gaming,I AM Alive is a very overlooked game,"So back in the xbox360/ps3 days i stumbled upon a hidden gem called ""I AM Alive"" its a more of a ""realistic"" take on a post-apocalyptic survival game, although it was a low budget and a short game, but it had a really good gameplay design, the combat was more of mind game you played with the enemy you basically appraoched them and when they see you they try to attack you and you could just fight them head on which was hard because they always outnumberd you and the ammo was very scarce in this game if you had any to begin with, or you could play it nice and pretend to surrender and when one of them approached you you could stab and kill him and quickly pull out your gun and aim at the others to scare them off or make them surrender, of course if they had a gun they would shoot back so it was smart to take the gunmen out first, the AI was really smart too sometimes they did not get scared by you pointing your gun at them because they thought you did not have ammo, and you could try to scare them by threatening them with an empty gun but if they  saw through your act you were basically dead, and you had to be careful and keep everyone in line of your sight because if you turned your back at them they would attack you, i liked that game mechanic very much because the fights just seemed more realistic and meaningful, it was an essential part of the game, i really wish after so many years we get a game that utilizes these kind of gameplay and mechanics for a change.

fzxphr,gaming,4 points I believe is crucial to make a good horror game,"#Tragedy in story

You have to feel something for the antagonist. If there isn't some kind of human element, the antagonist becomes unrelatable and the audience detach from it. Poignancy also works. The fallen hero kind of antagonist. Marguerite Baker in Resident Evil for example. 

&gt;Marguerite was once a caring, loving, dutiful, kind, and traditional aged housewife who became twisted under Eveline's ""gift"", becoming a demented, sadistic, insane, and psychopathic shell of her former self.

Being able to see her former self through the psychotic and sadistic shell she's become makes her so much more terrifying. It humanises the monster.

#Setting

The location should be familiar and comforting. That's what makes the demo P.T so terrifying. The corridor is unsuspecting, lived in and homely. Then it gradually becomes more and more threatening. The danger should take place in somewhere you would normally feel safe. 

#Playing on expectation to build tension.

Here's a scenario. You hear a noise from the basement. You go into the basement, find there's a shadow looming in the depths. You turn the lights on, it's just a pile of washing. You turn around and leave the basement. You see a figure standing in the hallway. You approach the figure, it's just a mannequin. You turn around and a ghost walks right through you and disappears. Fake scare after fake scare for the audience to be on their seat not knowing when the real scare is going to happen. 

#Subtlety

So you're playing a video game and have to enter a specific room numerous times. There's a mannequin in this room. It's cluttered and doesn't stand out much. Blends in with the scenery. This mannequin is scripted though. After looking at it, turning away and looking at it again a certain number of times, it changes to a mannequin with its head smashed off. You might notice it and think ""Woah, that's fucked up. Who did that?"" or it might escape your attention, but stay lingering in your mind thinking""Something about this room is off.""",2,/r/gaming/comments/fzxphr/4_points_i_believe_is_crucial_to_make_a_good/

g03du0,gaming,Problems with COD Black Ops for PS3,"Hello guys,

A few days ago I picked up used COD Black Ops for some nice price. Tried launching it, downloaded the update, and then ran the game.

The problems started in campaign. Some dialogues seemed lagged to the point where for a few minutes there would be no comments from our companions, and then they would just stack up to 5-6 lines of sentences. It would occur occasionally so it didn't bother me that much since my main goal was to have it for split screen and psn playing.

The much worse stuff started happening when I tried zombies or multiplayer.

I will start with the zombies as this is quite short. Game would go into zombies menu and after launching the session, game would freeze itself or the whole console on the comic book loading screen.

Now the multiplayer. Going into mp menu would work, but then when choosing psn option, game would go into black loading screen and then go back to mp menu but this time frozen, then again black loading screen, and mp menu etc. Split screen menu would work at all, pretty much the same case as the psn.

Then I decided to uninstall the update, and then the split screen menu would show up but would freeze again upon choosing any option. Zombies would freeze the same at the loading screen.

Normally I would assume it's the disc's fault as it has a few scratches, but these aren't big nor serious looking.

Could it be the disc's fault after all, or is it just black ops being retarted?",2,/r/gaming/comments/g03du0/problems_with_cod_black_ops_for_ps3/

Freespace 2, Nexus: The Jupiter Incident, Homeworld, etc. are games I was very fond of. Each of these is very different (Freespace is a shooty sim, Nexus is focused on ship/fleet tactics and Homeworld is a RTS) but they all revolve around ship-to-ship combat on large scales. 

There are quite a few contemporary space combat games on Steam but I'm not sure which ones are worth picking up. I'm inclined towards combat as the main focus but enjoy exploration as well. Not so big on trading/economy, however. I really enjoyed commanding my vessel and watching battles between fleets unfurl in Nexus: The Jupiter Incident but would love that feel in an open-world or procedurally-generated universe.

Not only did the game require you to hold a button to strafe as there was no separate left strafe and right strafe keys.......... But you can't even use mouse look around left and right because if you hold the strafe function, it makes your character strafe left and right when you try mouse look to aim around as you attempt the modern mouse and keyboard combo.

Why is this? I can tolerate having to hold strafe while moving with the arrows keys. But for aiming with mouse suddenly strafing left and right as I hold the keys? Its really insane! What was the logic for this old control scheme? Was there any programming limitation why no left strafe and right strafe buttons existed? How come they extended strafe even to mouse movements (thus making it hard to aim around with a mouse as you move using a keyboard)?Its not just Wolf 3D, the Dos version of Doom and a bunch of early FPS had this very awkward control function! Why? It becomes almost impossible to use mouse aim when attempting certain ambushes and quick attacks because of strafing changing mouse turn aim into literal left or right movements!",2,/r/gaming/comments/g09lc8/why_did_early_fps_not_only_forced_you_to_hold_a/

g0c4u9,gaming,I wanna see more game modes similar to Dante Must Die mode from Devil May Cry.,"I watch Maximilian Dood, Gab Smolders and Marz play the Resident Evil games and part of me thinks there could be some kind of 1-hit-kill/death mode. That said, it won't be as easy as you may think. Enemies would have ranks that determines what weapons will 1 shot kill them. For example, with Resident Evil 3 Remake: Zombies = pistol, dog = pistol, drain deimos = pistol, hunter B = shotgun, hunter Y = grenade launcher. Guns and weapons are based on rank, so pistol would also mean the rifles, shotgun is equal to the magnum, etc. While this may seem easy, any one single thing kills you as well, and you may or may not have the right weapon. This also means you must be much more careful. This may also suggest a number-of-shots idea as well, like 1 grenade launcher = 5 pistol or 3 shotgun shots, but this also means that you must hit the weakspots, not just any part of the body.

I did intend to mean many different games having a one-shot/hit/kill/death mode, but Resident Evil would make sense to me.",2,/r/gaming/comments/g0c4u9/i_wanna_see_more_game_modes_similar_to_dante_must/

Hello, I had a problem and I don't know if it's part of the monitor or if it's really a problem. The thing is, I have the Rog Swift PG248Q monitor and I have a problem with dark colors (any dark colors). The case is that it is a TN monitor and had a much cheaper TN and did not have this problem. I put some images for you to see, the image is seen as distorted. It should be noted that what was distorted was a completely black space. What should I do?    this happens in games and movies (whatever)

g1h548,gaming,Arkane Studios Needs Some Attention,"Hello to all the fellow lore nerds and head shotters! I wanted to create a post about Arkane Studios and a few of their games because I don't think that they receive as much recognition as they deserve. No, I am not employed or affiliated with them in any way, but I really want to encourage people to go out and spread the hype about their games. 

First off, Prey. Prey was huge! People loved it, but I'm sure there are people out there (like myself) who didn't realize that Prey is just one of many games that they have made/are making! I would highly HIGHLY suggest that if you liked prey you give Dishonored and Dishonored 2 a try. It seems to be a rather slept on series. It has a moderately active community but I personally believe it deserves literally THE BEST GAME of the decade award. If that exists. :) It is gritty, the lore bits alone will make you want to explore for any scrap of paper or book you can find on the maps. The combat is satisfying and really gives you that elite assassin feel. The art style is beautiful and Dishonored 2 is one of the most visually stunning games I've ever played. Play these games if you haven't. You are missing out.

Also on the roster that not many people are talking about is an up and coming game called Deathloop. Go watch the trailer! If you're a fan of Arkane, share the link. CREATE SOME BUZZ. These guys are so underrated and their games never come with loot crates or stupid microtransactions. It's all about extremely high-quality environmental world building and immersive gameplay. 

The only reason I'm making this post is that I just feel like, while they do get a decent amount of attention, they are not getting enough. These people are creating high-quality story-driven games that value experience over profit and that is a rare find in this industry today. So, support these types of studios! There's more to this world than Battle Royales! 

TL;DR Arkane Studios is a slept on gaming studio that has created and will continue to create some of the BEST story-driven immersive action sims of the last decade and you can and should be supporting them and spreading the word!",2,/r/gaming/comments/g1h548/arkane_studios_needs_some_attention/

And even back then, I really hated the camera and how clunky it played. The only two I played as a kid/teen were Survivor and 4. Then I was given RE2 Remake when I worked at GameStop. Played it and really liked it but dropped it cuz I somehow messed up my save file and was too lazy to restart. A year later I picked it back up and LOVED it. Big surprise for me since like I said was never fond of the series. I THOUGHT that I would just naturally gravitate to RE3 but put it off cuz I didn't have the money. But now that I can get it, I was wondering what people think about it and if it's worth paying $60. I've heard things like it's not as good as RE2, its way too short.

g1x0wy,gaming,A few physical questions for people that use mid/low sensitivity,"So I've used a really high sensitivity for years and years of gaming (3000DPI, 5 in-game for Overwatch as an example) but I've always had terrible aim (And I mean TERRIBLE. I can't track a tank in Overwatch strafing the same distance each direction and it'll take me 10+ seconds to kill them). In games like Overwatch and even Battlefield I've always had to play a support character because i'm more of a liability than anything else when it comes to aim (If you can't tell I've been playing a lot of Overwatch recently). Watching videos of decent players playing, it honestly looks like they're all aimbotting to me because as soon as someone changes direction or moves at all they keep their crosshair on them which seems like it'd require an insanely good reaction time.

I decided to try and lower my sensitivity to improve, but it doesn't seem to be working. There's some physical stuff I don't understand about using low sensitivity that i'd like some answers on (Overwatch again as an example, 800DPI and 5 in-game. Takes from the middle of my large mousepad to the edge to do a 180).

&amp;#x200B;

I assume you aim by moving your whole lower arm instead of twisting your wrist. I hear people saying that you generally don't keep your wrist on the mousepad at all, but how? You'd need to arch you're hand upwards and have your wrist bent downwards the whole time to keep it off, or do you just lift it a tiny bit (Which makes it feel like I have no control over the mouse and even clicking this text box takes a second or two)?

Do you keep your elbow on your table and pivot on it like you would your wrist when using high sensitivity, do you keep it off your table or do you move your upper arm too to aim?

How do you aim up and down? It makes you slide your whole lower arm to move the mouse which provides tons of resistance and makes you move your torso too.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated. I love FPS games, but sometimes it's hard to enjoy when you're as terrible as me. My spacial awareness, map knowledge and general skill is all pretty good (Not very impressive but I can get to Diamond as a support in Overwatch fairly easily) but I just can't aim to save my life.",2,/r/gaming/comments/g1x0wy/a_few_physical_questions_for_people_that_use/

My family and I are looking for a game to play with or against each over Xbox one, or our home computers: 2 PCs running Windows 10 and an iMac running 10.15 Catalina. 

My husband and I are casual gamers and our son [10] is fanatical. We love to play Halo split screen on the Xbox against each other but my son always wins because he screen-looks! 

We just finished Subnautica and absolutely loved it. We took turns on that one; hubby would stay up late and scavenge for minerals, build lockers and organize resources. Then my son and I would explore, scavenge wreckage and progress in the game. Tried Below Zero awhile back but way too glitchy. 

We would love a new Halo but lack of split screen for more than 2 players is a deal-killer.

Abstract

Imagine a living breathing Galaxy where you take part in. You are no hero, no chosen one. You probally know Games like Eve Online, No Mans Sky and the revolutionary X series. They all have very well known components that makes these games so special and addicting. All these Games give you, the player alot of freedom to do, whatever you want to do. The only boarders you get are the ones, the game is establishing. For example: You cant walk arround your spaceship in Eve Online. I often think about my „Dream Game“ and wanted to write my idea down and where i got my Input for this Idea and Concept. The biggest flaws all these Games have for me personally are their boundaries. I tested all of them for a very long time and the more i played these games i thought about it, what would happen if you melt these together. Here is my Concept of that.

Chapter 1: The Story

Well to be honest i really dont have a well written storyidea for this Game. But i think that a Story isnt even needed for a sandbox game like this. You, the Player should write their own story. Maybe there is like a small story, bound to the playercharacter that acts as a Tutorial, and show you how the Game works and explains ist systems to the player. Personally i would like to see different Storyarcs in the Game that doesnt get forced onto you. Like the different guilds in the Elderscrolls games. As you explore the Galaxy you will meet different guilds and its characters that unfolds into a bigger plotline. The Galaxy is in a continuous changing and the player can have a influence on that. As you explore and play the Game these different Plotlines unfold and make room for alot of choices where the player can choose from. I dont think it should evolve around a „saving the universe“ story. It woukd make sense if the storys are more believable. Like if you are part of a Tradersguild there is a competition between two smaller tradingcompanies and you can choose whom you may help. If you help one, it will change the economic status of the sector your are in and a bigger trading company asks for your help. Something like that. But i dont think the Story shoukd be a big Part of the game because its more about you, the playercharacter, evolving in that universe. 

Chapter 2: The World

Well like i already said, the game takes place in a big mostly open Universe. The Universe is divided by different sectors, each one with its politics and people. There are larger sectors, that are controlled by big companies and political parties. But there are also smaller ones, like lawless spaces where no one is ruling. This doesnt  compulsively means, that there rules violence. Maybe there are some people that dont want to be part of a big system and more live on their own. Some of these sectors are on war but it can change while you play the game. It should have like a really dynamic politicsystem. Maybe something like the Mount&amp;Blade games. Each one with its rulers, politics, chiefs, generals etc. So the sectors have their own personalities. In each sector there are different Planetsystems (like in No Mans Sky) and you can explore these Planets. They have different „Specs“ and ressources on them. In a lawless sector you can Just build where you want to but in more controlled sectors you have to buy land to build on. It shouldnt be a very dangerous Universe. The Humans have mostly explored the most of it and are now colonizing the different planets and sectors. You, the Player can have a huge impact on this world and its politics. You should be able to conquer all of it or lead the different parties to peace. 

Chapter 3: The Character

The character is fully customizable. When you start a new game, you can choose the looks, the starting Skills and very own traits like in a D&amp;D game. Skills i image would be important are:

-	Diplomacy (How you can act in different situations)
-	Charm (How much other poeple like you)
-	Intelligence (Well…)
-	Farming (Sets how you are doing in planting down trees and seed on a planets ground or in a big space ship with aggriculture parts)
-	Flying (Sets which ships you can fly and how well you can manouvre them)
-	Politics (Sets how well you know the different parties and can use you politicall skills on them)
-	Trading (Sets up the profit and prices you get wich the different traders)
-	Crafting (What you can craft and how well it is made)
-	Machinery (How well you can reapair your structures like ships and bases)
-	And many more (look at Eve Online skill trees)

All these skills can be obtained by playing the game and how you choose to play. Some have to be earned and skilled and some are lvling up while you play the game. The skills are very important because they are limiting your possibilities at the start of the game. So you will not be able to fly the biggest fighterships or can just go on a planet and build up a big mineralmine. You have to learn these skills step by step to build your own empire. 

Chapter 4: The Space and its Ships

It is a spacegame so ofcourse the Space is very very Important. You can find minerals, asteroids, space stations and big fleets in it. The most important part of the game are in my opinion the ships. 
There should be plenty of them. Hauler, Miner, Trader, Builder are just some ideas for the different categories the ships are under. There are different manufacturers like in Eve Online but you can Fly them in the first person view. You should also be able to walk in them like in Star Citizen so you can really embreace the new Ship you just bought. You should be able to fly direct or change to a strategic overview of the universe where you can controll everything you own like in the X-Games. 

Chapter 5: The Planets

The Planets are mostly empty except a few citys on some of them. The human race just startet to conolize that Part of the universe so there is alot of Space. You can build your bases on the Planet and can buy land where you start your Imperium. You can build your own settelments. Each of this settelments will grow organic and get bigger as time flyies by. It would be great as a mix of strategy and the typical „survial base building“ like in Ark oder Conan Exiles. The game „Two Worlds“ had a little townmanagment in it. I think somethin like that would be really fun.

Chapter 6: What is this game about?

So you start as a nobody with a small spaceship and some credits. You will get out in the big open world and do what you like to do. Want to build a big trading company, specialized in asteroid mining? Do it. You want to have your own little town and trade different goods between different towns, planets, sectors? Do it. You want to make you own empire and rule over the universe? Do it. Like you are hearing out the game should be a mix of the complexity of Eve Online, the Systems of the X-Games and the world of No Mans Sky with its dozens of planets. A big sandbox that evolves around you while you are taking part in different Jobs and activities. 
The game should be singleplayer and multiplayer so you can play with friends and make guilds.

g2hhza,gaming,Just bought a New 2DS XL,"Lengthy story with a TLDR at the end

Since the whole pandemic and lockdown I have found myself to be quite bored with TV and as such nothing else to do. I sold all my consoles (XB1 X, PS4 Pro, 2DS, Switch) a few months ago without any real regret.

Now I really needed something to do and thought ""hey! I'll buy a 3DS"". Well shocker, the prices of new 3DS's have skyrocketed and I looked at the New 2DS XL instead. Well, surprise, nobody has them in stock except GameStop who is closed for the foreseeable future.

Since i had nothing better to do, I started calling Best Buys and Targets in a 25 mile radius while ignoring their out of stock inventory on the website. To my surprise, a Target about 15 miles away said their inventory was off by 5 and they had 5 units in stock. I quickly got dressed drove over and they had one waiting for me.

Initial impressions are that for $150 it's not too bad of a deal, especially considering all the Virtual Console content and games. Form-factor is worlds better than the 2DS (even with the rare 2DS controller grips I have) and very comfortable. My only complaint is the power button and the lid wobble.

I think I am enjoying it more than I did the Switch. Maybe all the games that I can play, especially ones I grew up with? Maybe the cost of the games? Don't know but I am loving it.

TLDR- Isolation boredom was getting to me after having sold all my consoles, got a New 2DS XL by pure luck and have been playing happily ever since. Not particularly thrilled by build quality but am enjoying it.",2,/r/gaming/comments/g2hhza/just_bought_a_new_2ds_xl/

g2hq6z,gaming,"Looking for a game with a control scheme like ""Brothers: A tale of two sons.""","I've been trying to find a way to introduce my girlfriend to gaming for a while now, but unfortunately, she has a handicap which limits her fine motor skills. Her left hand is next to useless in this regard and her right hand has trouble doing more than 1 thing at the same time.  

On a hunch I downloaded ""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"" to try out with her. Due to the simple nature of the controls this game is actually playable for her, as long as I use the left half of the controller. 

One stick and one button is very do-able for her, though it shouldn't get much tougher in regards of quickness than what this game offers.

Are there other games with co-op and simple controls that I could introduce her to?

\- It has to be playable with one hand (keyboard is fine too, WASD  and 1 button should work.)

\- It has to be co-op, so we can play together

\- No high-speed reactions needed.

\- Preferably no gore (though if it's cartoony, it's fine).

If you have suggestions, I would be forever thankfull! She seems extremely happy to share in my hobby, and I want to share ""my world"" with her.",2,/r/gaming/comments/g2hq6z/looking_for_a_game_with_a_control_scheme_like/

Problem is: my spouse and I have no idea what we are doing here (dot gif) -- I looked for some on a popular auction site and was overwhelmed by options. I never played video games, ever, but for Mario Bros back in the day, so please forgive all my Stupid Questions.

I'm  figuring I will get a used family bundle with 4 controllers, etc,  and some basic games like Just Dance, Mario Bros, Mario Kart. I'd like active games (think Wii sports) to be playable, and would like to spend under three hundred all in, which looks like a reasonable price point based on my search. I know this stuff can get SUPER pricey, but we don't need anything fancy.

If you're gonna be working for a company with such high standards for what they do you should expect more hard work than usual.

g31tf9,gaming,My pitch for an ultimate alliance sequel based loosely on fear itself,"I was thinking the game would have (not counting DLC)six arcs and each Arc would have 3 missions. And during each Arc you would have a different lair.I was thinking the main groups of playable characters would be members of the mighty, members of The uncanny avengers/avengers unity squad and members of The avengers academy.

The main villain of a story is an ancient Asgardian called The serpent God of fear.he was Odin's older brother and rival for the throne of Asgard. He built a planet similar to Asgard and has a team of generals with hammers similar to Thor's called the Worthy. Odin finds a way to crash the serpent's planet into a larger water planet called abyss with the serpent on it. Odin kills the Worthy and throws their hammers into the oceans of abyss. The serpent's followers attempt to find the hammers and their leader. But abyss is a huge plant about four times larger than Earth covered completely in water the oceans are hundreds of miles deep so deep at the bottom of the ocean is covered in ice. Because of the planets size the serpent's followers are never able to find thembecause the search is like looking for a drop of water in the ocean.after being trapped on the planet for a million years an event in the story of the game cause the oceans on the plant to boil allowing The serpent and his hammers to reach the surface. During his time in abyss the serpent has been able to tame many of the sea monsters on the planet and even though they never found him his followers never gave up searching for him. his followers could have two main looks some look like undead Vikings that are covered in algae and seaweed some look like werewolves who have become aquatic with gills and fins. HIs hammers still possess The souls of his generals and he sends them to midgar do you find new worthy to wield them and become his new generals.

A star near Earth solar system is about to go supernova. The energy from the supernova is predicted to hit Earth and cause super storms.

The prologue will be in three arcs the calm, the storm, and the aftermath.

In the calm sword/alpha flight (the branch of shield that deals with exclusively extraterrestrial threats) is able to get advanced warning about the supernova so Earth has time to prepare. Shield, the superheroes, and governments around the world struggle to prepare for the impending disaster.how many people around the world are in a panic about the disaster other thank the supernova is a hoax to make the superheroes and the government look good some believe it is not a natural disaster but that the supernova is an intentional act of terrorism caused by the mutants. To show solidarity with mutants Steve Rogers forms the new avengers team call the unity squad that will be made up of humans , inhumans, and mutants.

The characters that are members of the mighty are summoned an unknown Asgardian. She as old as Odin and is a talented blacksmith. She tells them that Earth has a bigger threat than just a supernova approaching.the supernova will not only affect Earth but it will free an ancient evil Asgardian the serpent the god of fear from his prison. She wants to create a team of mighty warriors who's she will gift mystical Asgardian weapons that she created. She hopes that this team will be able to stop the serpent when he comes to invade Earth and later the rest of the nine realms. She makes them go through a series of trials most of the summon characters are able to pass and are given the weapons. the weapons increase their powers and in some cases give them new powers.

The storm the mighty are sent back to Earth the supernova has finally hit Earth and started the super storms. Despite all the preparations it turns out not to be enough.The heroes of Earth do all they can are able to save a lot of people.unfortunately they can't stop a natural disaster and thousands of people still die.

The aftermath the world is in chaos after the super storms. Thousands of people around the world are displaced or killed by the storms.parts of the world are dealing with large influx of refugees. Many criminals are using this as an opportunity to become bandits and pirates snice governments are too weak to control them. Anti mutant hysteria has also reached a boiling point with many blaming mutants for the supernova.There are also rumors of sea monsters being seen, super-powered supervillains with hammers like Thor, and sightings of undead Vikings and aquatic werewolves. Also the hulk and the thing have gone missing.

The next three arcs will be the main game they will be called the blitzkrieg, the Worthy, and fear itself.

The blitzkrieg The red skull has emerged as leader of a very large anti-mutant movement called axis. The movement is able to overthrow several governments in Europe and Africa. Red skull makes his daughter Sin who is found a hammer of the Worthy his second-in-command.Eventually access launches and invasion of America and a large battle happens in Washington DC. The heroes are able to defeat the armies of axis and the red skull. But sin escapes and joins the new team of superhumans like her with hammers like her called the Worthy

The Worthy this Arc focuses on the Worthy or attempting to ready the way for the serpent to conquer midgar. The heroes attempt to stop the worthy from accomplishing this.They're able to get the hulk and the thing to give up their hammers and leave the Worthy. The final boss battle in this ark will be sin.

Fear itself despite defeating the worthy the serpent has still arrived on Earth. In this ark you'll have to defeat sea monsters that he has tamed. And a final epic battle against the serpent himself.

I was thinking that there would be a couple arcs of DLC that would make up the epilogue. I haven't thought of what they would be yet.",2,/r/gaming/comments/g31tf9/my_pitch_for_an_ultimate_alliance_sequel_based/

So is this an attempt to rescue the game and turn it into a viable product, as has happened with Star Wars Battlefront II?

g3m5qi,gaming,Favorite raid or defense in gaming,"Note, that when I say ""raid"", I don't mean like in an MMORPG, where you gather up to 24-39 friends for some endgame raids, like in World of Warcraft and the Destiny series.  I mean in *any* game, including single-player games, where you're either raiding an enemy facility or defending your own.

For me, my favorite raid is the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2.  During that mission, any time I make bad choices throughout ME2's campaign, like who's loyalty mission I didn't complete, as well as during the suicide mission itself, like no upgrades to the Normandy's weapons, armor, and shields, or the wrong teammates for the wrong jobs, my teammates could die throughout the mission.  And if all of them are wiped out, then Commander Shepard joins them all.  Though, luckily, throughout every playthrough, especially with guides and walkthroughs by my side, I was able to keep my entire team alive and thus see their character arcs gain satisfying resolutions in Mass Effect 3.

As for defense, it's something that you don't even participate in yet is also as much a part of the Mass Effect trilogy as the suicide mission, and that's the War Hero background.  That is, Commander Shepard defending the human colony of Elysium from the Skyllian Blitz single-handedly until the cavalry from the Systems Alliance rescued him/her and the colony.  Like, I could just imagine that being a playable mission in the Mass Effect trilogy, instead of just something you can't participate in at all even if you select it as one of your three psychological profiles for Commander Shepard.",2,/r/gaming/comments/g3m5qi/favorite_raid_or_defense_in_gaming/

g3psai,gaming,Consumables: My eternal pet peeve,"tl;dr: First playthrough + [Too Awesome to Use](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse) trope don't mix and developers don't seem to care.

This topic seems to pop up every now and then, especially in cRPGs, but I've rarely seen a satisfactory explanation on HOW exactly you're supposed to use these limited, usually single-use per item, consumables. Other players just blow their entire wad right away, while others (like me) end up hoarding consumables and ends up selling them to vendors for mere piddling pennies.

Most topics seem to start with question ""How can I get out of this mindset?"", but I'm starting to think it's much less of a You -issue than a design issue:

1. The first question after receiving a consumable popping in my head is ""Will I get another one of these? If so, when and how regularly?"". On a first playthrough it's practically impossible to know the answer beforehand, unless you specifically look it up online.
2. Secondly, ""When am I supposed to use this thing?"". Unless it's placed conveniently in a container before boss fight OR unless an NPC specifically tells you to ""Use fire on a troll to kill it"", it can be difficult to gauge when and where you'd wanna use it. Which leads to...
3. ""But what if I need it later?"". Again, it's close to impossible to know for sure whether this consumable is best used here or not. And then you end up with 99+ Potions in your inventory by the time end credits roll.
4. ""I'm never gonna use these, might as well sell them"". As a player, if my options are either hoarding consumables I may or may not (usually latter) or selling them and buying a new piece of equipment (which I'll use continuously), I'll pick the latter 9 times out of 10 simply because piece of equipment doesn't disappear when used. For a developer or GM, it must feel depressing to put effort in designing consumables that provide various bonuses, only to see them treated as mere vendor trash. In a long run it will demotivate the game developer/GM, eventually leads to homogenized ""Healing Potion Variant #24"" design. Now that I think of it, this is probably a big factor in why consumables rarely see innovations.
5. ""How finite are these consumables?"". Yet again, on a first playthrough I'll have absolutely no idea how many of these consumables are scattered through entire game. I don't have a problem with single-use consumables per say, as much as fearing ""If I use this, it's gone forever"". However, if the game just showers me with low-mid tier consumables on regular basis, I'll have no qualms in using them.

Only game in my recent memory that did consumables right is Pillars of Eternity I &amp; II. Reasons why I actually liked consumables in PoE's were:

1. You can make a big variety of consumables. Potions, scrolls for spellcasters, different sorts of explosives for trappers, you name it! Instead of being at the mercy of pre-distributed consumables, YOU get to choose what consumable you want and when. It still costs you money and they're not immediate ""I win!"" buttons, but they still feel useful.
2. Crafting materials are readily available, you can (almost) always make more. The game lets you craft consumables, crafting materials are sold by merchants who will restock after certain number of days have passed. Restocking vendors and crafting by themselves aren't anything new, but they just complement one another so well. Speaking of money and vendors...
3. You have the OPTION to grind encounters &amp; loot for money if you want to, but the game doesn't expect you to grind. On the contrary: You don't get XP for killing monsters after your Encyclopedia entry on specific monster is at 100%. In other word, the game offers potential for infinite money making and worthwhile money sinks too, but you're not punished for not grinding either. This in turn opens an interesting playstyle...
4. You can build a viable character around consumables. You can make a pirate-y rogue who specializes in bombs (regular grenades, flashbangs, stun grenades etc.), an arcane spellcaster who tosses divine buffs via scrolls (or vice versa) or a warrior who dabbles in alchemy &amp; soups himself/herself up via self-brewed potions. You still have material cost tied to consumables, but it's **entirely up to you** if you want to make your character a Batman-esque ""consumable-user"" (and get rewarded for your dedication) or would you rather play a more common wizard/priest/rogue/warrior archetype.

This really made me think how consumables could add fun gameplay mechanics to the game, but so many games seem to squander this by settling to old formula ""let's just slap pre-determined consumables in pre-determined locations and call it a day"".

But that's enough rambling for now. What's your thoughts on consumables, do you use them as they pop up or do you hoard 'em till the end credits? Would you like to kick your hoarding habits or not?",2,/r/gaming/comments/g3psai/consumables_my_eternal_pet_peeve/

g3uc6a,gaming,Game Recommendations,"Hi all! I'm hoping some of you can give me some ideas for some games to try out. Recently I've been getting into games with that whole ""Open, Living, and Changing World"". Games where you're just some guy running around, not some special hero. I've been playing Outward, Elex, and X4 just to name a few that kind of stick with this idea. These games aren't the best games I've ever played, but I do like what they attempted to do. I'm wondering if anyone knows any games that accomplish this idea really well? This is what I'm looking for primarily -

1. Open world. Doesn't have to be massive. I'd prefer a smaller world with a decent story and interesting characters, rather than a giant empty box. The kinds with the occasional quest giver who wants you to fetch this or kill that.
2. Impact. I like the stories where my actions actually have impact, not just on the main story, but side quests too.
3. Factions. It's nice when these games have some options on who to join, different opposing groups with differing values and ideas on how to solve a problem. Also gives some replay value.
4. Preferably something lesser known. Yes, I know about Skyrim and Fallout and all the big names. However I find they fall into some of the major traps i mentioned before. Like having massive worlds with nothing interesting in them. And giving you a false sense of choice where no matter what you do it seems like you're going in predetermined path, instead of allowing player choice to have any actual direction. Along with other issues. Not saying these games aren't great, just not what I'm looking for.
5. I really don't care about the genre. It can be anything, a first or third person RPG like Outward, a CRPG like Pathfinder or the original Fallouts. As long as it somewhat meets the flavor of an open-ended, living rpg.

That's basically it. I'm really looking forward to hearing some suggestions. Don't be afraid to suggest something even if it doesn't fit the bill perfectly, or if it's a little bit strange or out there. I really want to know what some of your guys' favorite games in this area of design are. Thanks, and all ideas are greatly appreciated!",2,/r/gaming/comments/g3uc6a/game_recommendations/
