fwmdg0,politics,"I am Marc Elias, voting rights lawyer here to discuss how to prevent disenfranchisement and voter suppression in the wake of COVID-19. AMA.","I am a lawyer working to elect Democrats and protect voting rights. In March, I launched [Democracy Docket](https://www.democracydocket.com/): a new tool in the fight against Republican voter suppression. The website features the latest in voting rights and redistricting litigation and shares my commentary on the greatest obstacles to casting a ballot. I also publish a monthly newsletter -- On the Docket -- that you can subscribe to [here](https://email.perkinscoie.com/27/2064/landing-pages/subscribe-form.asp?sid=1149d757-d3e8-41d4-88cc-2850784140c3). 
 
In the wake of COVID-19, I’ve repeatedly emphasized the need for states to enact safeguards to protect all voters, specifically by adopting my [four pillars to vote by mail ](https://www.democracydocket.com/2020/03/safeguard-voting-rights-with-vbm/)and my [five rules to protect voting in person.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/how-fix-voting-right-now/609454/) Currently, I am leading voting rights litigation in over a dozen states. You can read about my team’s latest victory in Florida [here](https://www.democracydocket.com/florida/), learn more about the [emergency litigation](https://www.democracydocket.com/emergency-litigation/) we’ve filed in response to the current outbreak, and follow me on Twitter at [@marceelias](https://twitter.com/marceelias) for ongoing case updates. 
 
I look forward to answering your questions...my dog’s name is Bode.

fwp42m,politics,Megathread: President Donald Trump Removes Watchdog Overseeing Rollout of $2 Trillion Coronavirus Bill,"President Trump on Monday replaced the Pentagon's acting Inspector General Glenn Fine, who had been selected to chair the panel overseeing the rollout of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed last month, Politico first reported.

 A group of independent federal watchdogs selected Fine to lead the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, but Fine's removal from his Pentagon job prevents him from being able to serve in that position — since the law only allows sitting inspectors general to fill the role.

g67l0f,politics,"The Washington establishment thinks it can decide who will face Susan Collins in November. I say Mainers should have a choice. I’m Betsy Sweet, and I am running for US Senate. I’ll fight for Medicare for All, marijuana legalization, a GND ＆ will always be on the side of working-class Americans. AMA","When Susan Collins threatened our right to choose by voting for Kavanaugh and then 30 other anti-choice judges, I knew we needed new representation in Washington. Out-of-touch politicians and Washington elites are looking out for their own interests, not ours. It's time for new leadership in D.C.

That’s why I’m running for U.S. Senate in Maine. As a life-long activist, political organizer, small business owner and mother, I know we can do better when it comes to electing leaders who will represent Mainers. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has put into sharp focus the glaring systemic injustices of our political and governmental systems, and we need a strong leader who will fight for Medicare for All, livable wages, paid family and sick leave and who will work to strengthen unions.

We are at a tipping point in this country. We either stand up, and vote for the values that will actually help us in our lives or we continue to compromise and follow middle-of-the-road politicians and their special interest donors down the path to no real change.

I have more legislative experience than any other candidate in this Democratic primary. I’ve been an advocate for 37 years. I’ve made it my life’s mission to stand up to greed and to speak truth to power. That’s why I helped write and pass the first Family Medical Leave Act in the country right here in Maine. It’s why I helped write and pass Maine’s Clean Elections Act. It’s why I fought for and helped get Ranked Choice Voting in the Pine Tree State.

I am proud to have the endorsements of Our Revolution, Brand New Congress, Democracy For America, Progressive Democrats for America, Friends of the Earth Action, Justice Democrats, Women for Justice - Northeast, Blue America, Forward Thinking Democracy, Local Berniecrats and American Progressives in STEM.

fx8ajy,politics,"I’m Russ Cirincione, a New Deal Democrat for Congress. America needs a federal jobs guarantee, a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, pandemic protections and a UBI. I want to get the money out of Washington, and the People in. AMA!","I have a few questions for everyone: How can Americans have peace of mind, if our government isn’t protecting us from pandemics and the climate crisis? Can you imagine how much happier everyone would be if all basic, human needs were guaranteed as rights? Also, are you doing ok in this national emergency? Please DM me if you think I could help, even if it's just to listen. 

About me: I’m 32 years old, a government attorney, and a dad. The climate crisis is the greatest threat to my son’s life and his future. We have ten years to clean up our world and it’s now or never. My home will flood twice a month by 2035. A new gas pipeline is proposed a few miles from my house. The fossil fuel companies will not stop until every ounce of oil on this planet is burned. They have come for my family – and they’ve messed with the wrong father.

I support the Green New Deal to protect our homes and our families. The federal jobs guarantee will create millions of good jobs, even during national crises like this one.

For four years I’ve been a public servant, an attorney for housing justice, for New York State government. Last year I helped draft a law to protect ~200,000 people in manufactured homes, mostly seniors. We banned unfair evictions and banned fraudulent lenders. I also defend the Rent Stabilization Law in court. I support rent stabilization and housing for all because no one should be homeless.

As an organizer and activist, last year alone, one movement I volunteered for blocked wall street from purchasing up a local town’s water supply, and another required a local town to buy 100% renewable energy. I’ve learned that even small changes make a big difference, and every fight counts. But it takes armies of ordinary people to effect it.

The system is rigged for the top 1%. Billionaires buy elections, mega corporations crush out small businesses, they buy tax loopholes, they pay less tax than working people, and they get so many government handouts. The main reason our government doesn’t work is because of the money in politics. We have to ban lobbyists, ban private donations, and switch to publicly financed elections. If we get the money out, it’s the reform of all reforms.  

That’s why I’m committed to never take a penny of corporate PAC money, nor lobbyist money. One cannot have two masters, it’s either the money, or the People, and I choose the People.

I’m a New Deal Democrat. I want to guarantee you and your family peace of mind in a chaotic world with basic economic rights. Healthcare as a right with Medicare for All. A UBI (with no strings attached). We need to rethink our food system, ban factory farms, increase food inspections, indoor vertical farms for organic food at cost. We’ve got to end the scam of student loan debt, college should be free. I want to expand social security to be enough to retire on. I want to end endless wars overseas.

I'm running in the Democratic Primary for New Jersey's 6th Congressional District (Middlesex and Monmouth Counties) . 

The incumbent Democrat I’m running against, Frank Pallone, has been in office for 32 years, and he’s powerful. As chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, he could call a vote on almost any bill. He’s sponsored by millions from big pharma and insurance, so of course he blocks Medicare for All (HR 1384). He takes millions from fossil fuel companies, so of course he thinks the Green New Deal is unfeasible. Well, I think it’s mandatory. His “Clean Future Act” is corporate socialism–Americans would pay the price to build fossil fuel pipelines, until 2050. This is failed leadership and it’s 20 years too late. I’ve been waiting for real, meaningful change my whole life. The time is now.

I hope you join our campaign! We’ve raised about $25,000 from an average donation of $26, and we’re seeing our lowest numbers these past few weeks. So I really need your help!

In a letter to the Senate Intelligence committee chairs, Trump said he ""no longer"" has the fullest confidence in Atkinson. The letter says the removal will be effective ""30 days from today."" Trump added that he would be submitting a new nominee for the position to the Senate ""at a later date.""

Atkinson first raised concerns about a complaint involving President Trump's communications with Ukraine, which led to the impeachment inquiry.

fyhjxn,politics,"Hey Reddit! My name is Nabilah Islam, I’m a progressive Democrat who is running for U.S. Congress in Georgia’s 7th District to fight for Medicare-For-All, a $15 minimum wage, and a Green New Deal. AMA!","First of all, let me give quick thanks to the moderation team here for giving me the opportunity to talk with all of you. As a quick background on me, I’m a 30-year-old Bangladeshi community activist, and a proud progressive running to fix our broken healthcare system, end student loan debt, and fight for immigrants and working people. 

I’m the daughter of working-class Muslim immigrants, and I grew up watching my parents work long and hard hours for us to just barely survive paycheck to paycheck. My first experience dealing with the American healthcare system was in high school when my mother herniated two discs while she was working in a warehouse. The insurance company preyed upon her lack of proficiency in English, and they initially refused to cover her care. As a high school student, I had to help my family navigate the legal proceedings to force the insurers to pay. As unfortunate as it is to say, my experience with the healthcare industry is not unique. Every day, countless hard-working Americans are being denied their human right to healthcare. It is for this reason that I strongly support Medicare for All.

I believe that the environmental strategy we adopt going forward should not be milquetoast, the stakes are simply too high for that. Our strategy should be bold, and it should be substantive. In my eyes, the Green New Deal resolution is our only option, as I genuinely believe it is our only path forward if we want to prevent an environmental catastrophe.

While many believe that Georgia is completely red, the 7th District is most certainly not. The Republican incumbent won in 2018 by just 433 votes, and he has already announced that he will not be running for reelection in 2020. The 7th District also has a rapidly increasing population of immigrants and young people. These are the people that the establishment has most significantly let down, as well as the exact kinds of people who most strongly resonate with the progressive values of our campaign.

I’m extraordinarily honored and grateful to say that I have been endorsed by some really amazing progressive organizations, such as Sunrise Movement-Atlanta, Occupy Democrats, and Metro Atlanta DSA. I am also proud to say that I have been endorsed by some truly exceptional individuals from within the progressive movement, such as Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, Congressman Ro Khanna, Randy Bryce, and Dr. Abdul El-Sayed

Like millions of young Americans, I owe nearly $30,000 in student loans—and like nearly a quarter of my district, I have no health insurance. I’m running for Congress because I know firsthand that incremental change doesn’t work. Georgia’s 7th needs bold, progressive solutions: Medicare for All, student loan forgiveness, and an economy that actually works for working people.

g0orjb,politics,Megathread: Senator Bernie Sanders Endorses Joe Biden For President,"Ex-Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed former rival Joe Biden during a virtual event on Monday.

fxv6a8,politics,"I am Pat Soulliere, 34, and I’m running for the Idaho House of Representatives against a 12-year incumbent. I’ve worked in Esports/gaming for more than 10 years and I’m prepared to serve my community. AMA!","Hey everyone! I’m Pat Soulliere (pronounced Sue-lee-air, in case you were wondering), and I’m a first-time candidate running as a Democrat for a seat in the Idaho House of Representatives in District 20 Seat A. 
 
I’m 34, and an executive at a Fortune 150 company, but have quite a unique job. I’m a manager of gaming and Esports, and I’ve been in the industry since 2008. I’ve coached and managed players and teams that have won over a dozen world championships, and the games I was most involved with were Starcraft II and Heroes of the Storm. I’m the first person from the Esports world making a run for public office. 
 
My time in Esports has shown me the power and importance of community, and that led me to a desire to focus on my local community through public service. I’m running not only because our elected officials are out of touch with the average person, but also because the current incumbent in this seat is a Republican who has spent the past 12 years ignoring his constituents, taking money from every corporate business and political action committee he can, and getting nothing done that actually helps Idahoans. He also hasn’t said a word about the current coronavirus crisis, as an example of his “leadership.” 

This is the first year he’s had a legitimate challenger, and here are some of the major issues I’m focused on: 

Education: Idaho ranks 51st in spending per student, which shows how chronically underfunded our schools are. I am committed to making our schools whole again, because it is one of the most important investments we can make in our future. 

Health care: Idahoans passed Medicaid expansion by a wide majority in 2018, and my opponent tried to overturn the will of the voters and invalidate the election results. I want to expand rural health care access and listen to what my constituents need. 

Transportation: My opponent is chair of the House Transportation Committee, yet funding for transportation in Idaho is estimated to be $235 million short every year. Idaho needs better infrastructure for traffic management, and investments in public transportation. 

I wouldn’t be running for office if I didn’t plug my website and social media, so here they are:

Unlike my opponent, I’m here to listen. So, ask me anything!",387,/r/politics/comments/fxv6a8/i_am_pat_soulliere_34_and_im_running_for_the/

Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:

1. **Every top-level comment must contain a political cartoon.** This means no text-only top-level comments.
2. **It must be an _original cartoon_**. This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation.

Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:

1. **Every top-level comment must contain a political cartoon.** This means no text-only top-level comments.
2. **It must be an _original cartoon_**. This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation. 
3. **Each top-level comment should only have a maximum of 3 cartoons.** 

That's all. Enjoy your weekend!",277,/r/politics/comments/fz6v6a/saturday_morning_political_cartoon_thread/

g5lgl1,politics,"I'm Benjamin Teitelbaum and I spent two years following Steve Bannon and other populist ideologues throughout the world - they are into some wild stuff, and it is not what you think. AMA","My new book ""War for Eternity"" tells the story of my time following and speaking with political thinkers throughout the globe who embrace a bizarre political school called ""Traditionalism"" (always with a capital T). Chances are you've never encountered it. It comes from a variety of religious teachings, and argues that humanity is in a process of decline marked by increased upheaval and uncertainty, a scrambling of prevailing orders, and the spread of mass, homogenized societies. But Traditionalists also think that history moves in cycles, that chaos and destruction are the last stage before a cataclysmic rebirth into a better world. That means that the insecurity of our age, as they see it, should be welcomed. And whereas in the past Traditionalists were typically operating on the margins of society, it is now represented in positions of formal and informal power throughout the world, among influencers like Steve Bannon in the United States, Aleksandr Dugin in Russia, and Olavo de Carvalho in Brazil. Some of these people are called ""fascists"" or ""Nazis""--my book says those labels don't even get to the heart of it.  https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062978455/war-for-eternity/

g0vxtq,politics,Megathread: Jill Karofsky Projected to Win Wisconsin Supreme Court Race,"Dane County Circuit Judge Jill Karofsky defeated conservative Justice Dan Kelly to win a 10-year term on the Wisconsin Supreme Court in results released Monday from last week’s chaotic spring election.

The race was officially nonpartisan, but the high court has become heavily politicized in recent years. Liberal groups poured more than $2.4 million into the race for Karofsky, while conservatives spent more than $2.5 million for Kelly — who also drew President Donald Trump’s endorsement.  Karofsky’s victory narrows the court’s conservative majority to 4-3 and gives liberals a shot at seizing control when the next seat comes open in 2023.

AMA.","I am running for Congress because I’m worried about the future of working class families. Housing, healthcare, and education have become prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of the residents in my district, and those are some of the easier issues I aim to tackle. People recognize that corruption is a serious problem that is ruining our democracy, and I want to use the skills I learned as an anti-money laundering analyst to eschew corrupting forces from our government. My platform includes a series of anti-corruption measures aimed at doing just that. As for my opponent, he’s a seminal member of the “Old Boy’s Club” in Hudson County who takes corporate PAC money, is pro-ICE (did I mention this is a predominantly Hispanic community?), and has virtually no presence in the district. **I’m Hector Oseguera and I’m running to represent the interests of  working-class people.**

We need to build a better system that includes single-payer healthcare &amp; investment in public health. I'm Robbie Goldstein &amp; I'm running for Congress in MA-8. AMA","At the hospital, I join my colleagues on the frontlines of our community’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We see everyday how this crisis has compounded existing inequalities, and made it even harder for people in our district to get by.

I have spent my life serving my community. My dad was a dentist and my mother ran the office. Growing up, my sister and I joined them after school and in the summers, and their commitment to caring for each person who walked in the door inspired me to become a doctor. I married my husband, Ryan, in 2008 here in Massachusetts, fully recognizing the importance of equality for all.

I now work as a primary care doctor and an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital where I am particularly focused on those living with and at risk for HIV. This work motivated me to  push for the structural change needed to care for vulnerable populations,, and establish the hospital’s Transgender Health Program. Over the past five years, I have worked with my colleagues to build a clinical program that provides high quality, personalized care to some of the most vulnerable in our community.

Working on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic has strengthened my resolve to achieve healthcare for all. It has further solidified my belief that healthcare is about more than having an insurance card in your pocket. Healthcare is having a safe place to live. It is being paid a livable wage and being guaranteed paid sick and family leave. It is about clean water and a livable planet. It is about reliable public transportation and infrastructure. And, it is about creating national priorities that put people first.

It’s time to think bigger, and push for transformative change. That’s why I’m running for Congress.
